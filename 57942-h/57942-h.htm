<p>We awoke one morning; our gipsies were gone;
our camp was gone; no light shining through as we
lay in our tent. No freshness of the morning air;
no wafted perfume of fragrant wild flowers; no music
of the waterfall in the glen below. We were left to
pursue the pathway of our journey alone.</p>

<p>Yet our notes <i>de voyage</i> remained to us. Impressions
caught on the wayside of travel&mdash;written by
the light of actual circumstance&mdash;we give them to
our readers. They are a true episode in a life.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Since the succeeding pages were written, Norway
and Sweden have mourned the death of their King,
Carl XV., at Malmoe, on the 18th September, 1872.</p>

<p>The dedication of this work is, therefore, with the
kind and special permission of his present Majesty,
King Oscar II., inscribed “In Memoriam.” Thus the
work opens to the reader with a shadow of melancholy;
for, in our experience, few kings have had the love
and affection of their subjects in a greater degree.</p>

<p>One memorable event marked the close of his late
Majesty’s reign, as if to illumine the last sands of the
hour-glass of his life&mdash;the millennial period of the
unity of Norway as one kingdom was accomplished on
the 19th July, 1872.</p>

<p>A thousand years had elapsed since Harald Haarfager
(the Fair Hair) gained the battle of Hafsfjord,
and united Norway under one crown.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span></p>

<p>At Hafsfjord, by a strange coincidence, King Harald
Haarfager, having reigned, it is said, from about 861
to 931, was buried, according to the ancient sagas, near
the town of Haugesund, not far from the scene of his
memorable victory, the last of a series of conquests
which gave to Norway one king.</p>

<p>The battle of Hafsfjord also accomplished King
Harald’s vow, and gave to him the hand of Gyda,
the handsome daughter of Eric, King of Hordaland,
who, in answer to his proposals, had said, she would
never throw herself away, even to take a king for a
husband, who had only a few districts to rule over.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The obelisk of granite, erected near Haugesund, on
the grave of Harald Haarfager, to commemorate the
event, is seventy feet high. Surrounding its base,
twenty-one pillars, eight feet high, are inscribed with
the names of the twenty-one petty kingdoms, into
which ancient Norway was formerly divided. Bronzed
reliefs on the pedestal record that Harald Haarfager
is buried beneath, and that the monument was erected
one thousand years after he had consolidated Norway
into one kingdom.</p>

<p>At a grand National Jubilee Festival, at Haugesund,
on the 19th July, 1872, his present Majesty the King
of Norway and Sweden,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> then Prince Oscar, with a
large assemblage of the people of Norway, inaugurated
the monument.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span></p>

<p>The day was fine, and the associations of a thousand
years carried the mind back through the far distance
of time to the battle of Hafsfjord, when, to apply the
words of “Sigvat the Scald,”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loud was the battle-storm there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the King’s banner flamed in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King beneath his banner stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the battle he commands.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His late Majesty was also a poet and an artist.
Two interesting volumes of the late King’s poems,
entitled “En Samling Dikter” (a collection of poems),
and “Smärre Dikter” (short poems) are the scintillations
of a bright and imaginative mind&mdash;“Till Sverige”
(To Sweden), “Borgruinen” (the Castle Ruins), “Fjerran”
(Afar), “Ensamheten” (solitude), “Trosbekännelse”
(Confession of Faith), “I drömmen” (I Dream),
“Hvar bor Friden” (Where dwelleth Peace), “Kallan”
(The Fountain), “Ziguenerskan” (The Gipsy Girl), with
other poems form the Innehål, or contents of the
“Smärre Dikter.” The larger volume&mdash;“En Samling
Dikter”&mdash;includes “Heidi Gylfes Dotter” (Heidi Gylfe’s
Daughter), “En Viking Gasaga” (A Viking Saga)<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
“Hafsfrun” (The Mermaid), “Tre Natter” (Three
Nights), and several other poems.</p>

<p>The full-paged portrait of his late Majesty Carl XV.
is an excellent likeness. He was cast in Nature’s most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
perfect mould; whilst his mind had true greatness and
noble-hearted chivalry.</p>

<p>It is beautifully engraved by the author of “Scrambles
Amongst the Alps,” indeed, this and the engravings
illustrating this work, which have all been taken from
original sketches of the author, or photographs obtained
specially for the work, are by Mr. Edward Whymper,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
to whom the author is much indebted for his prompt
attention, when a very short space of time could only
be allowed for their completion.</p>

<p>An additional interest will also be felt by the reader
in knowing that the work is true, even to the names of
the gipsies.</p>

<p>So must close our Introduction; and, as we look
back to our tented wanderings, they seem as a bright
summer’s day, whose sun, setting on the horizon of our
fate, reflects itself, though with imperfect gleams, within
this book, whilst the day is gone for ever!</p>

<p class="hang">NORWAY&mdash;OUR GIPSY TENT&mdash;TENT FITTINGS&mdash;COOKING APPARATUS&mdash;COMMISSARIAT&mdash;GIPSIES’
TENT&mdash;BAGAGE DE LUXE&mdash;WEIGHT OF BAGGAGE&mdash;TRANSIT&mdash;DONKEYS&mdash;OUR
PARTY&mdash;ESMERALDA.</p>

<p>The picturesque and lovely scenes of Norway offered
many inducements for our campaign. The peculiar
advantages of tent life would enable us to wander in its
wildest Dals. Its beautiful fjelds, fjords, and fosses could
be seen at our ease. We might bivouac in the silent
forest; we could sleep in its lonely glens, and wander
in its deepest recesses, independent of the chance accommodation
of the “gjœstgiver-gaard,” or the more doubtful
comfort of the mountain “sœter.” The result of a
former visit had not been without its practical utility,
and the tent carried the day.</p>

<p>In previous travels we had used many kinds of tents,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
including Mr. Whymper’s very useful Alpine Tent. For
this campaign we had a new one made, such as gipsies
use. All experience inclined us to adopt this form of
tent as the most comfortable.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> It was made by gipsies,
whom we had often befriended in our search after gipsy
lore,&mdash;and who now no longer regarded us with distrust,
as belonging to the kairengroes (house-dwellers). When
it was completed, my people declared it was the best they
had ever seen. A stout back pole, with strong pliable
raniers or rods, fitted into it, and a cover made of two
pairs of light gray blankets, of strong but fine texture,
sewn together, with a broad edging of scarlet bocking,
gave it an appearance which the gipsies declared to be
perfection.</p>

<p>The interior fittings of our tent were not neglected.
One of Edgington’s waterproofs costing twenty-five
shillings, was laid on the ground as a substratum. A
handsome carpet, of strong but light material and warm
colouring, was cut to the size of the tent as usually
pitched, and then neatly bound with scarlet braid by my
housekeeper, who made nearly everything used for the
expedition. When the carpet was placed on the waterproof
rug, it formed an excellent floor to the tent. Our
large railway-rug, which had been with us all round the
world, was still serviceable. An extra rug for use if
necessary, and two air pillows covered with scarlet
flannel, completed the bed accommodation. A blue
partition-curtain, with broad yellow braid artistically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
elaborated in zigzag pattern, to be suspended <i>à volonté</i>
from the tent raniers for privacy and seclusion, left
nothing more to be desired. We had not yet sunk so
low in effeminacy as to use beds, though there are
instances of gipsies in England who have descended to
that melancholy state.</p>

<p>It was necessary that our <i>batterie de cuisine</i> should be as
simple as possible. In the first place we had our kettle
prop which had done duty in camp life in the previous
year. A kettle prop is a stout bar of iron bent at one
end so as to have a projecting portion for hanging the
kettle upon to boil water. The other end of the prop is
sharpened so as to make holes in the ground to fix the
tent raniers or rods into. (The three stakes joined together
at the top, with a large witch’s caldron suspended
over the fire, as seen in many representations of gipsy
life, have now passed away with the gipsies’ scarlet
cloaks once so fashionable.) We had our large fish kettle
for boiling anything; our tin can for boiling and making
tea for four persons; two larger tin cans for boiling or
fetching milk or water, all with lids; two large zinc
bowls; four smaller soup bowls, fitting one within the
other; a round tin with lid to hold three pounds of
butter; a quart tin can with handle; two sets of tin
pannikins, four each set, fitting one within the other;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
eight pewter plates; seven knives and six forks; eight
spoons; a tin salt box; a tin pepper box; a sardine box
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
opener; a frying pan, with handle to remove; a tin box
containing the exact measure of tea for four persons.
This was very useful, not only for economy, but in wet
weather,&mdash;the box, being filled in the tent, could be
carried in the hand,&mdash;in readiness for the boiling water.
A Russian lamp; a small axe; two tin boxes of wax
lucifer matches, and eight small cloths for cleaning, completed
our <i>service de ménage</i>. All the articles enumerated
could be conveniently put into the fish-kettle, except the
two large cans, the two large bowls, the pewter plates,
the frying-pan, and one or two other articles. These
were all placed at one end of a bag called the kettle-bag,
tied in the middle; our bags of tea and sugar, &amp;c., for
present use, being placed at the other end, ready to be
slung over the donkey for transit.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Our commissariat was selected with a care commensurate
to the requirements of the expedition and of the four
hungry <i>voyageurs</i> to be fed.</p>

<p>Our provisions were procured at Hudson Brothers,
Ludgate Hill, London (with whom we had before had
dealings), and were all we could desire for quality. Our
purchase included 28lbs. of Australian meat (costing 7½<i>d.</i>
per lb.)&mdash;which for the first time, we ventured, with some
hesitation, to take&mdash;two hams, some bacon, a dozen
boxes of sardines, 2 cheeses, a number of jars of Liebig’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
essence of meat, some tins of potted meats, 2 tins of
biscuits,&mdash;some of which were college biscuits,&mdash;rice,
oat-meal, pea flour, beans, &amp;c.; which, together with
12lbs. of tea from Messrs. Phillips, King William Street,
in small bags of 3lbs. each, were placed in a large stout
“pocket” as far as space would allow, and then packed
in a wooden case, and forwarded to the care of Messrs.
Wilson &amp; Co., Hull, ready for the steamer. The weight
of the provisions when sent, was 150lbs. These articles,
with 30lbs. of sugar in six small bags of 5lbs. each,
which we had before forwarded to Hull, completed our
stock of provisions for the expedition.</p>

<p>The gipsies brought their own tent rods; we found
blankets for the tent cover. The gipsies’ tent cover is
formed of two blankets, fastened with pin thorns over
their tent frame of raniers or rods. They had for use
one of Edgington’s waterproofs and two double blankets.</p>

<p>We also took a railway rug ornamented with foxes’
heads, which we often used with the aid of our Alpine
stocks, as a balk to keep off the wind, and to close in the
space between our tents when we required more room or
shelter. We had, besides, a very large but exceedingly
light waterproof sheeting, purchased from Edmiston,
made to loop over our tents, so as to enlarge them
considerably and protect us from heavy rain. The
blanket covers of our tents were not waterproof; and
this waterproof sheeting, which only weighed 4½ lbs.,
was invaluable. When we were resting during the day,
it effectually protected our provisions, baggage, and ourselves
from the heavy showers of rain which sometimes
occurred during our wanderings.</p>

<p>Our additional baggage consisted of one salmon rod,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
three trout rods, four Alpine stocks, two long ropes for
tethering the animals, a fishing basket, a tin box with
padlock, a musical box, a moderate allowance of clothes,
a small tin of blacking with brushes, hair brushes and
combs, soap, towels, pocket mirrors, writing-case, maps,
stout straps, books (guide books and others), fishing
tackle, &amp;c., two courier bags with locks, and a plaid
haversack, which contained a small case of medicaments
for use when we were beyond all chance of medical
advice&mdash;for, although fresh air is peculiarly health-giving,
there were times and seasons when we had to officiate as
the “cushty drabengro” (good doctor) of the party.
We had also in this plaid bag a silver-mounted glass
flask of imposing appearance, which was kept filled with
Brændeviin, to be poured out into a thick-set, solid-looking
drinking glass, that had been purchased, once
upon a time, at Épernay, in France; it was fitted to
stand the hard usage of this world, even to receiving
libations of brændeviin instead of champagne. The
glass is still unbroken, and ready to do duty in another
campaign; and when we look at it, our brain becomes
puzzled as to the number of bold Norwegians whose
lips it has touched as they quaffed its contents to
<i>gamle Norge</i>.</p>

<p>The weight of baggage is given in the following
divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The kettle and articles packed into it weighed 10½ lbs.;
bowls and pewter plates, packed separately, 6¾ lbs.; the
frying pan, 3½ lbs.; our boiling can for making tea for
our party, four in number, 1¼ lbs.; our large boiling can,
for a larger number than four persons, weighed 1¾ lbs.;
the large iron kettle-prop, 6 lbs. 6 ozs., making the total
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
weight of cooking apparatus and <i>service de ménage</i>,
30 lbs. 2 ozs.</p>

<p>The tent rods and pole weighed 14½ lbs.; the tent
blanket, cover, and partition-curtain, 17½ lbs.; large
waterproof siphonia cover, 4½ lbs.; small spade to dig
trenches round tent in wet weather, 1 lb. 15 ozs.;
total weight, 38 lbs. 7 ozs.</p>

<p>One of Edgington’s waterproof rugs, the tent carpet,
two rugs, and two air-pillows, weighed, together, 20 lbs.</p>

<p>Our large tent and fittings, with cooking apparatus
and <i>service de ménage</i>, therefore weighed 88 lbs. 9 ozs.;
and with books, fishing-rods, clothes, the provisions, and
other baggage, made a total of about 360 lbs. weight,
which allowed 120 lbs. for each donkey to carry.</p>

<p>The method of transit for baggage of all kinds, that
impediment to rapid movement, required careful consideration.
We had 360 lbs. weight of baggage to carry
across the sea, to take with us through the valleys of
Norway, to convey over mountains, and rugged paths,
across rivers and shaky wooden bridges. The kind of
animal suited to our expedition had also to be considered;
ponies and mules had their claims. Excellent ponies
might be purchased in Norway upon our arrival, but
then we had the risk of delay. If we took mules they
were oftentimes vicious and troublesome. At last we
commissioned a gipsy to purchase three strong donkeys,
to be specially selected for the purpose. It is said in
one of Dickens’s works, that no one ever saw a dead
donkey or a dead postboy&mdash;and this inspired additional
hope that the animals would survive the journey. We
had no reason to regret our choice. Donkeys will
endure want of food better than even mules or horses;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
they are patient, quiet, and tractable; they soon take
to the camp, and seldom stray far. The weight would
be about 120 lbs. each, decreasing as they progressed on
their journey. A strong donkey has been known to
carry for a short distance, 4 cwt., but this is exceptional;
200 lbs. for a journey on good roads they can manage
without difficulty; for rough mountain roads and paths,
this load ought to be reduced to less than 100 lbs.
Donkeys were much valued in early times; and in New
South Wales they were recently more expensive than
horses. Fortunately our gipsy was able to procure
them at a moderate rate; and in a short time I was the
possessor&mdash;to use gipsy language&mdash;of three “cushty
merles” (good donkeys). They were to travel with the
gipsies’ camp until we were ready to start, and so become
used to camp-life. Very good ones they were:<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Content with the thistle they tramped o’er the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never repined at the weight of the load.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was necessary for the success of the expedition,
that the party should be composed of not less than four;
but one who had before accompanied our wanderings,
was unable to come. Our preparations were partly
made, and his loss as a fellow <i>compagnon de voyage</i> was
irreparable. Skilful in designing and making a tent, full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of resource in camp life, never without an expedient to
overcome a difficulty, a sketcher from nature, cheerful
under all exposure, temperate in all his pleasures, ever
ready with his song and guitar; at eveningtide, by the
flickering embers of the camp fire, by the silent lake,
or in the mountain <i>cwm</i>, or lonely glen&mdash;his loss was
indeed to be regretted. His lithe figure, and luxuriant
raven-black hair, shading in heavy tresses his ample
forehead, jet-black eyes, and thoughtful countenance
bronzed by exposure, strongly resembled the true gipsy
type. By other gipsies whom we had chanced to meet,
he had been thought of better gipsy blood than our own
gipsy people.</p>

<p>Our right hand seemed gone. As we lounged into the
gipsies’ camp, there was no sun to illumine our way
to the north. The party <i>must</i> be made up to four; but
no other friend would venture on the exposure of a camp
life in a foreign country. The romantic scenery, the
novelty and charm of a nomadic life in nature’s wildest
scenes, completely failed to allure them from their comfortable
homes.</p>

<p>So the party was to be made up to four. The Rye
was not to go without a sufficient escort to take care of
him. Tall Noah would pitch the tents and pack the
animals. Esmeralda, as the forlorn hope, would do all
the cooking, and undertake the arrangements of the tent,
which our friend had beforetime done with our joint
assistance. Zacharia, the “boshomengro” (violin-player),
would again obtain water, and make the fire. They
would each have one animal under their charge. With
this arrangement we were obliged to content ourselves.
Esmeralda, who was nearly sixteen years old, was tall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
spare, and active, and wonderfully strong for her age.
She had dark hair, and eyes full of fathomless fire.
Zacharia had certain nervous misgivings about being
chopped up by a bear in his tent some night; tigers and
lions were also inquired after; but, all being settled,
there was no flinching, and our gipsies were ready on
the day named.

<blockquote>

<p>“He is an excellent oriental scholar, and he tells me that amongst
the gipsies are the remains of a language (peculiar to themselves) in
which are traces of Sanscrit. Sir David Baird, too, was remarkably
struck with the resemblance of some of the Sepoys to the English
gipsies. They are evidently not the dregs of any people. The countenances
of many of the females are beautiful, as those of the males are
manly.”&mdash;<i>The Peacock at Rowsly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">GIPSY EQUIPMENT&mdash;NORWEGIAN GIPSIES&mdash;PRESTEN EILERT SUNDT&mdash;THE
HULL STEAMER&mdash;THE TOURIST’S FRIEND&mdash;OUR GIPSY SONG.</p>

<p>The gipsies’ equipment and wardrobe was not extensive;
some additions given by the Rye made them up
<i>assez bien pour la voyage</i>. One or two waistcoats, and
a handkerchief or two, formed, we believe, the whole of
Noah and Zacharia’s change. But their boots! those
were unexceptionable. They must be new&mdash;they must
be thick&mdash;they must be nailed&mdash;double and treble nailed.
One shoemaker failed in solidity and soundness of substratum;
but at last, to the Rye’s comfort and inexpressible
relief, a more skilled follower of St. Crispin produced
some <i>chef d’œuvres</i> of ponderous construction,
which the gipsies admitted to be masterpieces. The
man who drove the nails had well-earned his wages;
the soles, indeed, at length resembled one of those old-fashioned
oak doors, that one sometimes sees in ancient
castles, or manorial residences. We duly discharged their
cost, consoling ourselves with the reflection that we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
not to walk in them through Norway. Esmeralda had
one dress to change. What it wanted in skirt, was made
up by the ornamentation of plaid braid, and silver buttons,
quite in accordance with the fashion of some Norwegian
districts. She had no bandboxes, chignon-boxes, gloveboxes,
parasols, umbrellas, caps, pomades, perfumes, and
a thousand other things often required. A long Alpine
cloak, and a few articles of change, formed a very slight
addition to our baggage.</p>

<p>There are Norwegian gipsies. Even Norway has
been reached by wandering hordes of this singular
people.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> We were desirous of comparing the language
of English gipsies with that of the Norwegian Zigeuner;
we were anxious to see some of the roving Tater-pak
of this Northern land. In our researches into the history,
language, origin, and probable fate of this wild,
wandering people, who still cling with remarkable tenacity
to their ancient modes of life and language, we had
met with the interesting works of Presten Eilert Sundt&mdash;a
gentleman who has given much time and indefatigable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
energy to a complete investigation of the present state
of the Norwegian gipsies, and has formed a vocabulary
of the Romany language as spoken by them in
Norway.</p>

<p>Presten Sundt’s notes will remain a valuable record
of the footsteps of this people in the world. His first
work, “Beretning om Fante-eller Landstrygerfolket i
Norge,” was published at Christiania in 1852; it was
succeeded by “Anden aars Beretning om Fantefolket,”
published at Christiania in 1862. To him the Norwegian
Government are indebted for the only information
which we believe has yet been given relative to the
Norwegian gipsies. The extracts from Presten Sundt’s
works, expressly made for us, will be found in the
Appendix to this work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our preparations had wonderfully progressed: besides
bags of various kinds we had three <i>pockets</i>, as the
gipsies call them,&mdash;one for each animal. The pocket is
a large broad, flat sack, sewed up at both ends, with
a slit on one side, which buttons. The blankets and
rugs, &amp;c., are folded and packed flat into it through the
slit or opening. Any hard substances are placed at each
end of the pocket, so that the donkey’s back may not be
injured. The pocket is placed flat over the tent covers,
and then girthed tightly round the animal. The bags,
tent-rods, and other things are fastened by cords passing
between the girth and the pocket.</p>

<p>A steamer was to sail from Hull in June, and we
ultimately arranged to take a return ticket from Hull to
Norway and back, ourself first-class, and the gipsies
second-class: our return tickets cost us £25, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the carriage of three animals, either donkeys or horses,
whichever we might wish to take, going or returning.
At one time we thought of going by the special steamer
to Throndhjem, intended for the convenience of sportsmen,
but as the voyage was longer, and the fare
considerably higher, we gave up the idea. Messrs.
Wilson were most prompt in giving us every information,
and when we had decided to go, they secured us
an excellent berth, and received our heavy baggage
when forwarded.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_014" src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BREAKING UP CAMP: GIPSY POCKET AND LOADED DONKEY.</p></div>

<p>We soon received a small publication, by John
Bradley, entitled, “Norway, its Fjords, Fjelds, and
Fosses, and How to See Them for Fifteen Guineas:”
with a tempting view of Norwegian scenery on the
cover. Unfortunately we could not travel at so cheap a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
rate with our party; but we recommend the publication
to intending tourists.</p>

<p>We now wrote to Mr. Bennett, 17, <i>Store Strandgade</i>,
Christiania, who is a perfect oracle upon all matters
pertaining to Norway, and gives ready aid to northern
tourists, and he at once sent the maps we required.
We afterwards received his newly revised Guide Book,
which is indispensable to all Norwegian travellers.</p>

<p>A gipsy song was composed by us for our campaign,&mdash;a
sort of souvenir, to be given here and there,&mdash;a
memorial of our visit; we had it translated into Norwegian.
It was a guitar song, with an engraved border,
illustrative of gipsy life. The music was arranged by
our friend, of whose regretted absence, we have already
spoken. He had taken it from an air, which he once
heard played, by an Italian boy, in the streets of London.
It had since dwelt on his memory. The following is
the music of the air, and the song follows, with a Norwegian
translation, which is said, to be exceedingly
good.

<p class="hang">A FRIEND’S MISGIVING&mdash;DARK FOREBODINGS&mdash;A SLEEPLESS NIGHT&mdash;THE
RAILWAY STATION&mdash;THE ALBION&mdash;A PHILOSOPHER&mdash;THE STREET BOY&mdash;DISTINGUISHED
TRAVELLERS.</p>

<p>We had nearly completed our preparations, and were
leaving town, when we dined one evening with a friend
whom we had not seen for some time. He seemed
interested in our approaching excursion, but his astonishment
was great, when our plan was divulged.</p>

<p>“What! going to Norway with gipsies?” said he in
amazement, as he poised in his hand, a glass of champagne.
“Why I don’t believe my friend Tom Taylor, who has
taken a great interest in the gipsy language, ever went so
far as to camp with them. You’ll be robbed, and
murdered&mdash;not the slightest doubt. Travel with gipsies!”
exclaimed our friend, and he seemed to shudder at the
thought</p>

<p>We were quite unable to say how much self-sacrifice
Mr. Tom Taylor may have made. We had read his
interesting collection of Breton Ballads. He writes well
on a great variety of subjects, and is an excellent art
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
critic; but we could not give any opinion upon his camp
experience. My friend shook his head, “Write to me
when you get there,&mdash;promise to write me a letter,” said
he earnestly. “Yes, you will be certainly robbed, and
murdered,” and he silently emptied his glass.</p>

<p>There was something touching in his manner, as he
gulped down the effervescent draught, with a look which
showed plainly that he had no hope for our safe return.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room the subject seemed one of interest.
We gave our friend a promise to write. As we left the
house, his adieux were those of separation, for the last
time.</p>

<p>It had been a wild rainy night. What with packing,
and writing letters, we never went to bed. <i>Mes gens de
la maison</i> remained up also. After a very early breakfast
we were <i>en route</i>. As we drove up to the railway
station of a large populous town, we caught sight of our
gipsies. They were waiting for us with the three
donkeys in the shelter of some open building of the
station. The gipsies looked wet, draggled, and miry, but
full of spirits. As we stepped from the carriage, a porter
took charge of our twelve packages.</p>

<p>We had received previously full and explicit information
from the passenger department as to the trains and
expense of transit, and had engaged a horse box to Hull.
One of the officials, seemed rather astonished, when he
found three donkeys, were to be conveyed in the horse-box,
he scarcely seemed able to connect a horse-box, with
the proposed freight.</p>

<p>A stray policeman seemed puzzled at the retinue.
The three gipsies, saluting us with <i>Shawshon baugh,
Sir?</i> (How do you do, Sir?) marched up and down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
platform, apparently much pleased at our arrival. The
stray policeman wandered about, as if he was up, and
down, and nohow, as to what it all meant, or whether the
gipsies, belonged to us, or themselves. He was lingering
near, when we produced a 10<i>l.</i> Bank of England note at
the booking-office, in payment for our tickets. A new
light then beamed on his mind, and we did not see him
again. The horse-box was paid for. The porter got
labels for all our packages, and timidly ventured to
inquire the use of the tent-rods, which he had curiously
regarded for some time. We secured a second-class, and
a first-class compartment in the same carriage, all was
arranged, the signal was given, and we were off. We
had only one change&mdash;at Leeds&mdash;and no stoppage. The
horse-box went right through. A pleasant <i>compagnon de
voyage</i>, accompanied us most of the journey; he had
lately come from the blue skies of Italy.</p>

<p>The gipsies were joined by an inquisitive fellow-traveller,
in a white hat. Some people trouble themselves
about everybody else’s business but their own.
He cross-examined them, as to who we were, and where
we came from. “Gloucestershire,” said Noah&mdash;“we all
came from Gloucestershire this morning.” “You must
have started very early,” said the inquisitive traveller.
“Oh, yes,” said Noah with emphasis&mdash;“very early.”</p>

<p>It was a damp, wet morning, as we arrived on Friday,
the 17th June, 1871, at the Hull station, and found
ourselves on the platform. We left the gipsies, to look
after the donkeys, which were put in some stables at the
station; and taking all our things in a cab to the <i>Albion</i>
steamer, we put them on board. Messrs. Wilson were
called upon. They are prompt men of business; to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
their word in all things. Ample arrangements would
be made to shelter the donkeys during the voyage, and
we paid our fare. At the station on our return we found
a civil porter waiting for us, and having paid the stout
stableman 1<i>s.</i> for each donkey, the gipsies took them on
board about one or two o’clock in the day.</p>

<p>Much curiosity was created when the gipsies came on
deck. The steward of the vessel said, they seemed to
have lately come from a warm country.</p>

<p>The <i>Albion</i> steamer had small, but comfortable second-class
accommodation. No meal could be had until seven
o’clock; but the second steward managed to get the
gipsies some sandwiches and ale. They had been fed <i>en
route</i> in the morning, and were quite satisfied, with the
refreshments so provided.</p>

<p>During the previous wet night, they had camped some
distance from the starting point, and had ridden the
donkeys through the rain to the railway station. Noah
and Zacharia had no great-coats, but Esmeralda was
dressed in her long Alpine cloak, and treble necklace of
blue, and white beads. Her straw hat was surmounted
by a small plume of feathers, dyed blue, by one of her
brothers. She did not wear earrings, and had no other
ornament.</p>

<p>We had left the steamer to obtain some methylated
spirit for our Russian lamp, and to call at Messrs.
Wilson and Co.‘s, when we remembered, that we had
forgotten our watch-keys. A watchmaker’s shop was
soon found. The watchmaker was a merry-looking man.
The watch had always been provided with one key to
wind it up, and another to regulate the hands. We had
always been assured, that two different keys, were required.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
“Ha! ha!! ha!!!” laughed the watchmaker,
who was apparently a German, “I will give you one key
which will do the same thing&mdash;ha! ha!! ha!!!”</p>

<p>It was a beautifully formed key, nor had we ever met
with one like it before.</p>

<p>The watchmaker appeared to us as a second Jean
Batiste <i>Schwilgué</i> of Strasbourg.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> “Ha! ha!! ha!!!”
laughed the merry little man, “all is mystery. We eat
and drink, but we comprehend nothing. Ah! we often
end in believing nothing.” We remarked that no one
who contemplated with attention the works of Nature
could overlook the design of a great Creator. The
watchmaker went to an inner door. A pretty girl probably
his daughter, changed a shilling for him. “Ah!”
continued he, “you see by travel; you take in through
the eyes; they are the great vehicles of human life. I
laugh at them, ha! ha!! ha!!!” and he bowed as I left
the shop.</p>

<p>We were now nearly ready for the voyage; as we
passed from the gates of the railway station an interesting-looking
boy, pleaded hard to black our boots. It is
an honest way of making a livelihood. In this instance
we stepped aside&mdash;one boot was just finished, when
he suddenly bolted. Although he did not wait for
his money, he did not forget the paraphernalia of his
business. Another boy explained, that he was not allowed
to black boots so near the station, and a policeman
in the distance had caused his hasty disappearance.</p>

<p>The boy again met us soon after, and completed his
work; we were glad to have the chance of paying him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>When we went on board the steamer, all was confusion.
On the wharf, we had 1<i>s.</i> wharfage, to pay for each
animal. The total expenses of our party to join the
steamer amounted to 10<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> including 6<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> for
hay, supplied to the donkeys for the voyage.</p>

<p>The evening was damp and gloomy. An old weather-beaten
Norwegian pilot wandered about the deck. Men
in oilskin coats, smelling strongly of tar and tobacco-quid,
hustle and bustle, against everything. Very comfortable
accommodation, had been erected specially for
the animals near the engines, in the waist of the steamer.
Esmeralda was feeding them with hay.</p>

<p>When the gipsies were afterwards looking over the
side of the vessel, they formed an interesting group.
Then came the active steward, of the second cabin, who
promised us to take care of them. The second steward
was a small, but firmly-knit, active young fellow, who
said he had been wrecked twice, in the old coat he was
then wearing, and for which, therefore, he had a strong
affection; after saying he should go next winter to California,
he left us to look after his many arrangements.</p>

<p>We were informed that Sir Charles Mordaunt and
also Lord Muncaster,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> who had so narrowly escaped the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Athenian brigands, had left Hull in the special steamer
for <i>Throndhjem</i> on the previous evening.

<p>The steamer’s saloon was elegantly fitted up. Bouquets
of flowers shed their fragrance on each table; books,
pens, and ink had been supplied for the use of the
voyagers. One passenger soon entered, carrying a long
sword; another&mdash;a French gentleman&mdash;followed, and expressed
a wish to be in the same cabin with his wife. We
have pleasure in saying that we found the captain very
agreeable, and courteous.</p>

<p>The <i>Albion</i> steamer left the Hull docks at eight o’clock
the same evening, being towed out by a steam-tug. The
under-steward, went to meet some passengers, whose
arrival was expected by a late train, but returned without
having found them. The gipsies and ourself, as we stood
looking over the bulwarks of the steamer, took our last
view of the fading shore, and the steamer was soon fairly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
on her voyage. Our gipsies were almost famished; but
we managed to get them some tea, at nine o’clock, and
they went off to bed.</p>

<p>Our cabin was one of the best in the steamer. We
awoke as daylight dawned through the open bull’s-eye
window of our upper berth. Not feeling decidedly well,
or ill, we got up, to see how we were; then we had some
conversation, with our fellow-passenger in the berth
below. (We were the only two occupants of the cabin.)
This traveller, who was invisible behind the curtain of
his berth, informed us that he was going on business to
Gottenberg; while we told him, that we were going to
make a tour, in the wilds of Norway.</p>

<p>When we sought our gipsies, we found that they were
not up. In company with several of our fellow-passengers,
we afterwards sat down to a capital breakfast provided
for us in the saloon. The steamer had its usual complement
of travellers to Norway in summer&mdash;some for fishing,
some for health, and some for business.</p>

<p>One pale, gentlemanly passenger, whose acquaintance
we made, had met with an accident to his leg. Another
agreeable tourist, whom we will call Mr. C., was accompanied
by his wife&mdash;a tall young lady, with a Tyrolese
hat and feather. A young invalid officer, just returned
from Italy, had had the Roman fever, and was given up; he
had, however, recovered sufficiently to travel, and intended
going to Lyngdal to join some friends. There were also
two or three Norwegian gentlemen (one of them, a
Chevalier de l’Ordre de Wasa), a Scotch traveller with a
large sandy beard, and a tall, portly gentleman, going to
visit some friends near Christiania.</p>

<p>Finding we had three donkeys on board, the Chevalier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and another passenger accompanied us to see them. The
first-named gentleman, was especially interested in our
proposed excursion. How shall we describe him?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_028" src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He was rather under middle height, thick-set, and
strongly built; and occasionally his countenance expressed,
much animation, and good-humoured energy.
The information he possessed was extensive; he spoke
English perfectly; had travelled much, and knew Scandinavia,
and its people well.</p>

<p>The donkeys were declared very fine ones, especially
the large light-coloured animal, with a dark cross on its
shoulders, long, finely-formed legs, and beautiful head.
This donkey was about six years old, and we called it
the Puru Rawnee.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The next donkey, was a dark animal, five years old,
strong, but not so finely formed; although not so spirited,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
it endured all the fatigue of long travel, even better than
its two companions; we called it the Puro Rye.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The third was about four years old, with a beautiful
head, very lively, and was called the Tarno Rye.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> They
seemed to relish the hay, and made themselves quite at
home.</p>

<p>The donkeys became objects of <i>special</i> interest, and
the Puru Rawnee was <i>much</i> admired. Most of the passengers
had something to recount as to their impressions.
A Norwegian gentleman said that they had no donkeys
in Norway, which we afterwards found to be quite
correct. Another good-humouredly said, that sixpence
each ought to be charged, and the entrance closed.
Many were the suggestions, and speculations, concerning
them by the passengers, as they quietly puffed their
cigars. The gentleman of the Roman fever, who seemed
to be improving each hour, said in a significant manner,
during a pause in the conversation, “You’ll write a
book; your experience will be interesting&mdash;you ought
to write a book.”</p>

<p>We now went to find our gipsies, or what was left of
them. Esmeralda was lying on the deck, with her head on
a closed hatchway. She raised her head in a most doleful
manner, and said, “Very bad, sir.” Noah was lying
next his sister, and sat up for a moment looking very
wild. Zacharia was extended full length, perfectly speechless.
Evidently, they wished themselves on shore again.</p>

<p>Great curiosity was excited among the passengers to
see the gipsies. We explained, that they were in a very
prostrate condition&mdash;in fact, quite unable to hold much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
intercourse, with the outer world; but at length we
yielded, and introduced a party to them. The interview
was short, and as our gipsies were still lying on the deck,
and quite unable to do the honours of the reception, we
soon left them in peace. The passengers were apparently
much pleased with the introduction.</p>

<p>They were real gipsies&mdash;gipsies who had all their life
roamed England with their tents&mdash;none of your half-and-half
caravan people&mdash;an effeminate race, who sleep in
closed boxes, gaudily painted outside, with a stove, and a
large fire within. Ours were nomads, who slept on the
ground, and wandered with their tents, during every
season of the year.</p>

<p>The steward took care we did not starve. Our dinner
was quite a success. The table groaned beneath the
weight of soup, salmon, roast beef, veal, ducks and green
peas, young potatoes, puddings, Stilton and Cheshire
cheese, &amp;c., with excellent claret from a Norwegian
house at Christiania.</p>

<p>The gipsies did not give much sign of revival. During
the afternoon, we visited them now, and then, consoled
them, and gave the steward orders, to let them have
whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>We had a long conversation, with the Chevalier, as to
our route, through Norway. It had been our intention
to make Christiansand our starting-point, go through
the wilds of the Thelemarken, and visit again the Gousta
Mountain, and the Rjukan Fos. The Chevalier suggested
Christiania, as the best starting-point, taking
railway to Eidsvold, where, he said, Presten Eilert Sundt
resided. He then said, we could travel by road, or steamer,
to Lillehammer, and from thence through the Gudbrandsdalen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
He afterwards sketched out a very
long and interesting route, having its termination at
Christiansand, and we determined to follow as far as
possible his suggestions.</p>

<p>There were many inquiries by the passengers as to
how the gipsies fared, and we went to see them again
just before tea-time. Zacharia was in bed, and asleep;
Noah was just getting into bed; and Esmeralda was
in the second-class women’s cabin, with some tea, and
bread-and-butter before her, looking exceedingly poorly.
The close proximity to a stout woman who was dreadfully
sea-sick, was not enlivening.</p>

<p>The Norwegian pilot, who was a good-tempered old
man, had been much interested with the nails in the
gipsies’ boots; when they were lying on the deck, he
would sometimes stoop down to make a close inspection,
as if he were counting them. He said nothing, but
probably thought more.</p>

<p>The occupant of our cabin, when we saw him, was a
young man with an eye to business; in fact, some of
the passengers averred afterwards, that he could calculate
in a few moments, the exact amount, the steamer cost, to
a fourpenny nail. He seemed, however, to be very well
intentioned, in his inquisitive analysis of everybody, and
everything. He was said by some one to be a Birmingham
bagman, whilst others said he was a wandering Jew;
but whether Jew or Gentile, he took a decided interest in
the gipsies, and the donkeys, for which we suppose there
was some excuse. He had dark hair, eyebrows, and beard,
pale complexion, and generally walked with his hands in
his pockets, and his shoulders screwed up to the back of
his neck. His head, was inclined downwards, whilst he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
looked at you, with large rolling eyes, from under his
bushy eyebrows, with a quick upward glance of inquiry.
Now and then, he would walk off to see the donkeys, and
report on his return, to the other passengers, his views
as to their state of comfort, and happiness.</p>

<p>Somehow his opinion, did not appear to have much
weight with the other passengers&mdash;whether it was from
want of intelligence on their part, or obscurity of perception,
we could not say. At tea-time he sat opposite
to us; he dashed wildly into salad, and then said in a
loud voice across the table, “I have seen your donkeys;
I should like to go with you.” “You seem to like them,”
we replied. “No!” exclaimed he, very wildly; “it is
your gipsies’ dark eyes.”</p>

<p>“He is insane,” said the Chevalier, in an under tone,
to which we readily assented. The bagman certainly
did look wild; and it immediately occurred to us that
he slept under our berth, in the same cabin&mdash;not a lively
contemplation, but we were determined, not to meet
trouble halfway.</p>

<p>We had entered up some of our notes, and had strolled
on deck to enjoy the freshness of the sea-breeze, when
we found ourselves one of a small party of passengers,
whiling away the time, in pleasant conversation, in which
our captain joined.</p>

<p>“You must write a book,” said the officer who had
had the Roman fever.</p>

<p>“And dedicate it to you?” we rejoined.</p>

<p>“I will take one copy,” said one passenger.</p>

<p>“I will take three copies,” said our captain.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said another, “it should be on the saloon
table.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>“And then,” said another, “it will be interesting to
know the fate of the three donkeys.”</p>

<p>We admitted that, after so much encouragement, we
must write a book, and dedicate it to the officer, who
had had the Roman fever.</p>

<p>Several anecdotes were related. One passenger said,
“There was a house near Hyde Park, which formerly
belonged to an old gentleman, who left his property to
trustees on certain trusts, provided they buried him on
the top of his house.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Several instances were told of
persons desiring in their wills to be buried in their
garden; and one or two cases were mentioned where the
wish had been disregarded.</p>

<p>The weather became rainy, and our <i>compagnons de
voyage</i>, sought shelter elsewhere. We, however, still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
clung to the fresh sea-air, and as we paced the deck near
the wheel, we could not help observing the silent seaman,
gazing intently in solemn earnestness, on his compass, as
if, like Dr. Dee, he noted many things, within a magic
crystal. He was a good-looking, though weather-beaten
man, with a dark moustache.</p>

<p>In answer to an observation we made, as to the
weather, he said, “Well, sir, I never felt it so cold as it
was last Sunday&mdash;not even in the Baltic last winter,
when I had ice, an inch thick on my back. Why, I had
three coats on last Sunday!”</p>

<p>We then remarked, that there were few accidents on
the line of steamers.</p>

<p>“Accidents you think seldom occur on this line? Well,
I don’t know. There was the <i>Echo</i> last winter; not a
soul saved! I’ve slipped four in my time, as have soon
after gone down.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been lucky,” said we.</p>

<p>“Lucky? Well&mdash;if there is such a thing as luck; but
I think Providence ordains all things; I believe all
things are ordained for us.” Many sailors we have met,
have been men of deep religious feeling; below a rough
surface, we have often found much true piety.</p>

<p>The Chevalier still remained on deck, and we had a
long conversation about Iceland. The Icelandic language
is the same as the old Norwegian language; but
he told us that it is difficult for one who speaks only
<i>modern</i> Norwegian, to learn Icelandic. In Iceland, he
said, they were great snuff-takers; it was calculated that
each person took 2lbs. of snuff per head each year. Like
the Scotch, they had their mulls or snuff-horns.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock on this day, the thermometer stood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
at 62.° The ladies had scarcely appeared; they generally
suffer more than gentlemen.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve at night when we entered our
cabin to go to bed. The occupant of the second berth
was invisible, but not asleep; and he asked whether we
objected to have the cabin-door open. We were only
too glad to oblige him, and with the bull’s-eye window
open also, we had an agreeable atmosphere.</p>

<p>His mind was apparently still dwelling upon the
gipsies. An interrogating voice issued from the lower
berth, as we were preparing to go to bed.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have been writing your diary?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you will write a book? I will take
two copies. Have you a bed or a mattrass in your tent?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“That would not do for me. I should have an air
bed to keep you off the ground. You will probably stay
a day or two at Christiania? I suppose the gipsy girl
will cook for you? She will suffer, and be ill, won’t she?
You will have much trouble with her.”</p>

<p>We informed him she had more spirit, and was quite
as strong as her brothers.</p>

<p>Our fellow-passenger again continued, “Where did
you engage them?”</p>

<p>We answered, we had known them some time, and
they were attached to us; and then, wishing him good-night,
we left him to pursue his dreams of the gipsies’
dark eyes, which had evidently made an impression upon
him.</p>

<p>Our shrewd calculator was evidently under the gipsies’ spell.

OPINIONS.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the 19th of June, we rose at four
o’clock, and went on deck. The morning was cloudy;
not a passenger to be seen. The seaman at the helm
received our salutation. This one did not possess a
moustache, but he had his say, and said it. He philosophised
thus. His wages were not 4<i>l.</i> a month. “4<i>l.</i>,”
said he, “I ought to have; but if I did not take less,
they would ship men at 3<i>l.</i> who would. There were 300
men in the Custom House at Hull who never did more
than two hours’ work a day. They had not got it for
them to do. He had been to California, and had, by
gold digging, accumulated in a few months 350<i>l.</i>&mdash;was
stuck-up coming down the country&mdash;lost all&mdash;shipped to
Valparaiso, got about 80<i>l.</i>, and set up in business. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Spaniards and the Chilians had a row, and he walked off
and lost everything. Had not done much&mdash;did not know
where a man could go to make money&mdash;England was
overcrowded. They were emigrating now from Norway,
to the United States and Canada. Had tried Australia,
but did nothing there. Had seen men in Sydney who
were walking about, and could not get more than two
hours’ work. Thought it best to stick to England, though
he could not get higher wages; but, somehow,” said he
(finishing up) as he gave the wheel a pull, “we seem to
be all going along together; I suppose we shall come
out at some gate, or other. It beats me, but I suppose
it will be all right at last.”</p>

<p>We took advantage of early hours&mdash;our diary progressed.
Leave nothing to memory, but that page of
perception, which gilds the past, with a thousand golden
spangles. The tints of remembrance, give more genial
hue. As a record of truth, the facts must be rigidly
noted; they must have instant impress, if they are to be
of value.</p>

<p>One by one, passengers appear in the saloon from their
cabins. The Scotch tourist with a large sandy beard
enters. He was one in search of health, and had by
accident fallen thirty-seven feet, which nearly killed him.
Could not speak Norwegian&mdash;had been very sea-sick&mdash;was
going through Norway&mdash;thought the fall had injured
his head&mdash;felt very unwell, and looked it.</p>

<p>We get a cup of tea at 7·30. At eight o’clock,
stewards make their appearance, and bustle about. The
morning began to clear; passengers assemble at breakfast
in larger numbers and in better spirits. A fine day
is expected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Many inquiries are made after our gipsies and donkeys.
The gipsies were still unwell. Esmeralda managed some
beefsteak and tea as she lay on deck. The gipsies had
our best encouragement.</p>

<p>The barrister and the officer recovered from the Roman
fever (a member of the Naval and Military Club) were
both charmed with our gipsies’ names.</p>

<p>The officer especially so, and gave occasionally, the
following recitation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Upon a time it came to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That these two brothers die did;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They laid Tobias on his back,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And Ezekiel by his side did.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This quotation from a popular song, was considered a
very apt illustration, of the probable fate, of our two
gipsies, Noah and Zacharia, before the expedition was
ended.</p>

<p>The Birmingham bagman, was soon seen hovering on
the narrow bridge, leading to the forecastle above the
waist of the steamer. At times, he leaned upon the
handrail, and would look down upon the deck below,
where our gipsies reclined. Sometimes after gazing at
them, he made some observation to Esmeralda. Occasionally
he came to us, and was exceedingly anxious
about the donkeys.</p>

<p>So frequently did he come, and so many were his
suggestions, that at last we began to fear, we should be
in the same melancholy position, as Sinbad the Sailor,
with the Old Man of the Sea.</p>

<p>The passengers seemed most pleased with the name of
Esmeralda. The portly English gentleman said it was a
gipsy queen’s name. The barrister often hummed an air
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
from a favourite opera called “Esmeralda,” which had
been brought out in London that very season.</p>

<p>The Chevalier was in excellent spirits at dinner. He
had been engaged upon a diplomatic mission to England.
We discovered ourselves as Freemasons, which led to our
taking champagne together at dinner.</p>

<p>A young Norwegian, who spoke English exceedingly
well, and his English wife, sat near us.</p>

<p>The day had gradually become bright and lovely. The
steamer approached Christiansand. In the afternoon, we
sighted its forts. The town looked smiling, as if to welcome
us from the ocean. Several passengers were going
on shore: the portly gentleman, the officer who had had
the Roman fever, the Chevalier, and ourselves and gipsies
descended into a boat. The fare when we landed was
16 skillings. The officer was going to some place near
Lyngdal. We left him at the Custom House, passing his
baggage. As he wished ourselves, and gipsies good-bye,
his last words were, “Remember, I must have a copy of
your book.” We hope before this, he has recovered, and
is able to read these pages.</p>

<p>The houses of Christiansand are of wood; the streets
are broad, the pavement, when not Macadamized, often
rough and uneven. The town had wonderfully improved
since our last visit.</p>

<p>Christiansand recalled to mind the time, when a friend
and ourself, once landed there from England. We had
sailed in a small fishing-smack, commanded by Captain
Dixon. It was our first visit to Norway. We stayed
at the Scandinavian Hotel, kept by Madame Lemcou.
The hotel was very like a private house. No one spoke
English. Well, we remember our difficulties, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
kind old inhabitant, who called upon us. He had no
doubt come to place his knowledge of the country at our
service. His stock of English consisted of “your most
humble obedient servant,” which he often repeated. Our
knowledge of Norwegian, at that time was in comparison,
scarcely more extensive, so that our interview, ended
much as it began.</p>

<p>We rambled with our gipsies through the town. It
was a sunny evening. The inhabitants were also enjoying
their evening promenade. Although warm, and
pleasant, scarcely any of the windows of the houses, were
opened for ventilation. The sides of the wooden houses
were often covered with weather-boards, and painted.
Esmeralda, with her dark raven hair, and eyes; Noah,
with his tall figure; Zacharia decorated with a flaming
yellow “dicklo” (gipsy handkerchief) flaunting round his
neck in gipsy fashion, were severally scanned by curious
observers as we passed. Noah heard one person say in
English, “How healthy-looking they are!” We could
not help being amused, at the puzzled expression of some,
not excepting several young soldiers we met.</p>

<p>We walked round the cathedral, which was not improved
by whitewash, and possessed no chef d’œuvre
of sculptured ornament, to make us linger in our contemplation.</p>

<p>The old Runic stone in the churchyard of Oddernœs
Church, we had before visited. Noah&mdash;whose ideas no
doubt connected most views with sites for a camp&mdash;pointed
out one highly suitable on the bank of the
Torrisdals Elv. Time wore away, and we at length
made our way quickly down to the boats, waiting at the
rough wooden piers of the harbour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>We had a boat to ourselves. Esmeralda sat with us
at the stern&mdash;her two brothers sat on the seat opposite.
As the boatman rowed us from the shore, we thought
how strangely, we wander through the world, as we
follow the high road of life. When we reached the
<i>Albion</i> steamer, many passengers were looking over the
side of the vessel. We had no small change, when we
went on shore, but the portly gentleman kindly lent us
the necessary amount. On our return it was necessary
to pay the boatman. We gave him the smallest change
we had, which was a quarter of a dollar, and then
ascended the gangway with our gipsies.</p>

<p>The Birmingham bagman had been watching us.
“Ah!” said he, coming up, as we stepped on deck, “why
you gave the man too much. I saw you give a large
piece of silver to him. He pulled off his hat to you.
You spoil them.” We explained that we had no change.
“But,” said he, in a state of excitement, “you spoil
them.” We trusted it would do the boatman good, and
left him, to communicate his ideas of pecuniary compensation,
to some one else.</p>

<p>This he appears to have done; for very shortly after
the Chevalier coming on board, grossly infringed, the
bagman’s scale of payment, and he came in for another
storm of indignant remonstrance.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Chevalier, whose quiet humour nothing
could disturb, asked the excited bagman, why he did
not give the boatman the English half-crown he wanted
to get rid of? “Can you give me any discount?”
shouted the bagman, infuriated. The Chevalier calmly
answered, “Your appearance shows me, that you can
give me nothing to discount upon.” The bagman rushed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
off, and we found him some short time after, when we
went into our cabin, lying in his berth.</p>

<p>“I have had a row with that Dutchman,” said he,
beginning to unfold his melancholy history, when we
advised him to mind his own affairs, and went on deck.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen came on board at Christiansand,
whom we at once noted as salmon fishermen. Both
were handsome, though slightly past the meridian of
life. One was taller than his companion, with a complexion,
darkly bronzed in the summer’s sun, and by
exposure to the fresh air. He had been on board a very
few minutes, when we entered into conversation. His
companion, and himself, had been at Mandal, salmon-fishing,
but the weather was hot, and the water low, and
clear. The largest salmon they had taken was 18lbs.
My expedition incidentally became partly known in conversation.
He seemed much interested. We showed
him our donkeys, and he seemed to think our expedition
a heavy cost. Very shortly after, when we had parted,
our gipsies came on the after-deck, and said a gentleman
in a velvet jacket had sent for them. We told them to
return, and soon after saw Mr. T. interrogating Noah
on the fore-deck. We were rather annoyed at the time,
that any one should send for our people and question
them as to who their master was, and his name. When
we saw Noah afterwards, he said, “I told him nothing,
sir. He asked your name, and I told him ‘Harper.’”
Afterwards Mr. T. again joined us on deck, with the
portly gentleman and the barrister in search of health.
Mr. T. was afraid of sleeping on the ground, and having
rheumatism. He mentioned an American method&mdash;a
kind of frame which kept you completely off the ground,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
and folded into a small compass. We described our
tent, and many questions were asked about our method
of camping, which we explained. Most seemed very
anxious to know, how we became acquainted with our
gipsies. But we merely said that our interest in the
tent-dwelling races, had thrown us in contact with them.
The portly gentleman informed us that a species of viper
existed in Norway, but the snakes were not numerous.
He said he was once in the Thelemarken<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> district, and
having put up the horses in a shed, he lay down on the
turf. Some time afterwards when he got up, a small
viper, was found clinging to his coat, which, falling off,
the peasants cut it into pieces and burnt each piece
separately, since they have an idea that if the pieces
get together, the viper can piece itself again. When he
afterwards got into his carriole to continue his journey,
he felt a shivering sensation between his shoulders most
of the day. Mr. T. asked a variety of questions, about
our commissariat, and what we were taking, and seemed
much interested in the expedition. We gave him the
best information we could. He was one of the best
types of an Englishman we met with in Norway.</p>

<p>The passengers began to recover. The steamer had
been nearly two days at sea. The evening was beautiful.
We had been charmed with the rocks tinged with reddish
hue, rising in picturesque outline, from the Topdals Fjord.
The fringed pine woods of the shore, were mirrored upon
the almost motionless water, of the Norwegian frith.</p>

<p>The passengers were now more numerous at tea. Some
ladies joined us. All were looking forward to their arrival
the next morning at Christiania.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>It was delicious as we strolled on deck. What a
pleasant freedom there is upon the sea, away from the
hum, and noise, of the great human struggle, of many
minds, in populous cities! What bitterness and strife,
misery and evil, we had left far behind us!</p>

<p>As we paced the deck in the delightful contemplation,
of a summer’s eve at sea, we could not help noticing,
Mr. C. and his wife, with the Tyrolese hat and feather.
They were seated side by side on the deck, with their
backs towards us. In silence, they appeared lost in
happy contemplation. The surrounding light of circumstances
seemed to say, “We are one!” How pleasurable
should be the feelings of two hearts firmly united, holding,
as it were, silent communion with each other. By
a few touches of the pencil, in our small note-book, we
caught their outline. We felt we were in the hallowed
precincts of true love, and retired to another part of the
vessel, lest we should disturb their happy dream.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_044" src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We again lounged near the man at the helm. There
stood the sailor, with his compass before him, as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
vessel glided onwards from England’s shore. This seaman
was not one of our former friends, but he was a
rough, honest-looking, thick-set, hardy fellow; one of
those men, who carry honesty written in their countenance.
“Well, sir, I hope you will have a pleasant time
of it,” said he. We thanked him for his good wishes,
“That young lady,” continued he, alluding to Esmeralda
“has had more than one talking to her. There’s that
one, sir,” said he, looking towards the Birmingham
bagman, who was walking about in the distance, with
his hands thrust deep in his trousers’ pockets as usual;
“and there’s another that is just gone. But she is not
one of that sort; she let them go so far, and then she
stopped them short. She’s a very good young girl. They
have had a good education;” and he gave his wheel
another tug, as if to clinch the observation.

<p>The stewards were excellent. One had been shipwrecked
several times. “Rough work in winter, sir.
Most on the line get lost. At Hull most of the young
men who go to sea are drowned.” Not very encouraging
information, thought we, but such are the chances of a
seaman’s life. Having sent our gipsies to bed, we retired
ourselves. About twelve o’clock our first doze was disturbed
by a noise in our cabin. Looking round, we saw
the bagman with a bottle in his hand. He was taking
Lamplough’s pyretic saline, which he strongly recommended
for headache, or to set you right after drinking.
After taking his draught, he disappeared into his berth.
Our thermometer was 66°, with both port-holes open.</p>

<p>We were recommended to look out for beautiful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
scenery, at about seven o’clock the next morning. When
we went on deck, at an early hour, the weather was damp
and cloudy.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards we had a chat on deck, with our
fellow-passenger the barrister. He was going to Christiania,
and from thence by the coast steamer to the North
Cape. The coast excursion is a very pleasing one. Our
fellow-passenger was full of anecdotes and information.
Mr. T., after examining our gipsy, Noah, had said to the
barrister, “I find that the gentleman’s name is Harper.”
“You are quite in error, I can assure you,” said the
barrister, “the gipsies have only been cramming you.”
Mr. T. appeared much astonished, and we said it was
only what he could expect; and, although not done intentionally,
it was not exactly the right way to acquire
information; and any one doing so would not get much
for their trouble. We had risen at four o’clock. Our
portly fellow-passenger, was also up soon after, and wishing
us good-bye, descended with his portmanteau into a
boat, and left the steamer. This he did to save time,
not wishing to go to Christiania. We found afterwards
that a young Norwegian in the second cabin, would have
gladly availed himself of the same boat. He had been
absent eight years from his home, and friends, and was
anxious to see them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When he afterwards arrived at Christiania, he said, “I
have a dread, that I shall hear some bad news.” After a
short absence from the steamer, he again returned. His
worst fears were but too true, and he sat down, and cried
very much. Such are the melancholy scenes of life,
meeting us at every turn, and sadly remind us, of the
short existence of all things in this world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>The early morning was rather damp and wet. The
passengers were up in good time. Our gipsies we found
as gay and sprightly, as they had been before ill, and
prostrate. Mr. T. still seemed delighted with our expedition,
and visited from time to time our gipsies, with his
friend, whom we took for his brother. We mustered
well at breakfast, under the presidency, of our polite
captain. When we had finished, and returned on deck,
our title to be recognised as an accepted mason, after a
very rigid and searching ordeal, was at length acknowledged,
by Monsieur le Chevalier, who was exceedingly
particular.</p>

<p>From various circumstances, we had not been lately to
our lodge in London. We still retained pleasant reminiscences
of former visits, and especially of our reception,
at those Lodges we once visited in Paris, with our old
friend the Chevalier M.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> His Majesty the King of Sweden
and Norway is now one of the most distinguished masons
in Europe. May he long hold the proud position, of being
a monarch, whose power rests upon the affections, of a
free, and noble-hearted people.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The conversation at breakfast, was lively and animated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Most of the passengers were in good spirits, and seemed
delighted with the bright anticipations, of their approaching
wanderings, over fjeld and fjord. Even the Birmingham
bagman was better, and we noticed him, at some
distance from us, feeding his beard, in a most reckless
manner with egg.</p>

<p>What a delightful scene presented itself after breakfast!
From the steamer’s deck, we gazed on the beautiful
fjord, calm and glistening in the sun. The cloudy morning
was now changed&mdash;all was lovely, and filled the heart
with a dreamy sensation of pleasure. Rocky shores,
wooded islands, secluded maisonettes, and dark pine
woods, extended as far as the eye could reach, into the
boundless distance of endless woodland&mdash;one eternity of
nature, which reminded us of the stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There is a pleasure in the pathless woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There is a rapture on the lonely shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There is society where none intrudes<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By the deep sea, and music in its roar.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Soon after breakfast Mr. T. came to us, and said, “I
have asked your young man to play his violin, and he
very properly says he cannot do so, without your permission.”
Mr. T. was anxious to hear them play; we therefore
at once gave our consent. Noah came for one of
the Regent Street tambourines, then in our cabin, and in
a very short time the gay sounds of violin and tambourine,
were heard in the Christiania Fjord. Our gipsies were
grouped below the fore-deck, the sun was shining. The
travellers and sailors seemed much amused. “Why you
are travelling with your band!” said some of the passengers.
Nor shall we forget the tall form of our gipsy,
Noah, with his hat placed jauntily on one side his head,
as he rattled the tambourine, with a verve, and feeling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
which only one, of wild, strong passions can do. Mr. T.
came up. “I like your idea very much,” said he; “and
I suppose that young gipsy girl, will cook for you. I
admire her boots; they are something like boots. What
a difference,” whispered he, as a genteel, ladylike
passenger, passed near, whose small, thin, elaborately-worked,
fashionable boots, with high heels, and small
rosettes, just above the toes, certainly did not appear,
fitted to promote, the elasticity of the footstep, or comfort
of the wearer, among the Norwegian fjelds and fjords.</p>

<p>Then we had much speculation as to the astonishment
of the Norwegian people, when they saw our donkeys.
We were informed that the Chevalier’s father, had once
possessed the only donkey in Norway. This animal had
long since been dead, and Norway had been left without
a single donkey in all the land. Some said we ought to
make a charge for exhibiting them to the peasantry, and
an animated discussion took place, as to the amount of
duty to be paid, before they could be landed. One said
it would be the same as upon horses; another said that
the duty could not be the same as upon horses, and
they would have nothing to pay. Some passengers expressed
an opinion, that they would have to pass a law in
the Storthing, to assess the amount of duty, before we
could possibly land them, and it might cost us 20<i>l.</i> to get
them through.</p>

<p>As we approached Christiania, and our voyage was
nearly over, we had our account to discharge with the
stewards. Our gipsies cost quite a fortune. If they had
been ill at first, their appetites must have been ravenous,
towards the close of the voyage. The steward had been
told, to let them have everything they wanted to eat, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
to drink; we could not, therefore, say much, so settled
the bill. Both stewards, hoped we should come back in
the same vessel, and took some trouble to give us the
dates of sailing, from Christiansand. It was then our
intention to take the steamer from Christiansand, at the
end of the summer.</p>

<p>We met with another freemason on the morning we
landed at Christiania, whom we believe was chief engineer&mdash;a
very stout-built man, with a kind, amiable
disposition, whose every word rang, of open-heartedness,
and benevolence. He had a jolly, merry wife, and a
French poodle dog, which, of course, begged, and was as
intelligent, as those animals usually are. We became
very good friends. Before we landed he gave us a newspaper,
containing some verses, which, if we remember
right, were written by some man going to be hung.
Unfortunately, we have mislaid the gift. Our friend said
the verses had struck his wife, and himself, as being
most appropriate to the wanderings of ourself, and the
young people. They wished us all success, which we
sincerely reciprocated.</p>

<p>In the second cabin there was also a sea captain, and
his wife, from Australia&mdash;very kind people to our
gipsies; in fact, we could not help feeling, some tinge of
regret, that we were so soon to leave. Yet we were on
the threshold of camp life. We were about to continue
our former wanderings. The thread broken elsewhere,
was to be resumed in Norway. We must admit, that
the allurements of fresh scenes of nomadic life, softened
our separation, and gave us new hopes for the approaching
campaign.</p>

<p>Our baggage was mounted on deck, as we approached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Christiania. Very soon we had the city of Christiania
in full view, with the King’s palace, and castle of Agershuus.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
We could scarcely account for the feeling, but
Christiania seemed to wear a pleasant, homelike aspect,
which we liked. It was probably eleven o’clock when
the steamer arrived. A number of the inhabitants had
arrived on the pier. Mr. Bennett was there. Time had
favoured him, for he looked stronger, and we might say
younger, than when we were last at Christiania. One
of the first incidents before landing was a solicitation for
horse-money. It seems to be a kind of payment customary
for the benefit of the sailors; and it was hoped
that the donkeys, although not horses, would still entitle
the sailors to its payment. We had enjoyed such a pleasant
voyage, and were in such good temper, with all
on board, that we did not raise any objection to the
remuneration.</p>

<p>What a quaint, foreign-looking court-yard you enter
as you seek Mr. Bennett. Numbers of carrioles are
crowded together at the end of the court, ready for
distant journeys. Then you ascend some steps, to a
wooden balcony, and enter his suite of rooms. One large
room is completely full of Norwegian silver relics&mdash;tankards,
belts of a past age, carvings, paintings, engravings,
photographs of Norwegian scenery, maps,
books, and all sorts of articles, illustrative of the manners,
and customs of the Norwegians, of ancient and modern
time. We seem to have wandered into a dream-land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of ancient sagas, and ten to one you meet other spirits
who are doing the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett, the presiding genius of the place, had
probably ceased to be astonished at any mode of travelling
an Englishman might adopt. Williams had landed
with his knapsack, which resulted in an interesting work,
having the additional value, of giving a correct entry, of
the expenses of his expedition. MacGregor came <i>en
route</i> to Sweden, with his canoe, and wrote another
interesting work. Now an Englishman comes with
gipsies and donkeys! What next?<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The worthy English
consul, and <i>chargé-d’affaires</i>, who so well represents
our country, was absent from Christiania, but we were
introduced to his son. When he heard of our retinue,
grave doubts as to our safety, apparently crossed his
mind. He seemed to think it improbable, we should
return to our friends. It could scarcely be expected, that
Mr. Bennett could advise us, upon the best camping
grounds, but we must ever feel grateful remembrance to
him, for the trouble he took, to pass our things through
the Custom-house, and forward those left behind to
Eidsvold.</p>

<p>The cicerone provided for us by the Chevalier, dined with
us at the Victoria Hotel, Raadhuusgaden. The day was
lovely. We found some of our fellow-passengers, already
seated at the <i>table d’hôte</i>.

<p>There is often a pleasant sociability at a <i>table d’hôte</i>.
Mr. T. was there, the invalid barrister, the tall Scotchman,
and other travellers. Nor was the Birmingham
bagman absent, as the background to throw out the
lively tints of life’s experience. Mr. T. and the barrister
sat near us. Mr. T. was delighted with our plan of
seeing Norway, saying it was just what he should like.
Time passed quickly. We hastily terminated our dinner,
with some excellent Château-de-la-Rose claret, and then
bade our fellow-travellers farewell. As we left the table,
we saw the Birmingham bagman mournfully contemplating
his fork. Whether he was going to use it as a
toothpick, or whether he was calculating its cost, or
whether he was hesitating, as to the possibility of sleeping
in a tent without a bed, we know not. Whatever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
his thoughts may have been, we could have no unfriendly
feeling at parting, especially after his extreme
anxiety for the comfort of our donkeys, his admiration of
Esmeralda’s dark eyes, and his liberal offer, to take two
copies of our book. Be this as it may, we trust by some
mysterious method of calculation, he will make a handsome
profit to himself.</p>

<p>We found that Presten Eilert Sundt had not yet removed
to Eidsvold. The Chevalier kindly gave us a letter
of introduction to him, and we drove at once to his residence
in the suburbs of Christiania, which we reached at
about four o’clock. Ascending a large staircase, in a few
minutes we were shown into Presten Sundt’s sitting-room.
The “gipsies’ friend” was seated at his writing-table,
with his books, papers, and various accessories,
indicating active, and literary tastes. We met as two
spirits, who, though taking far separate paths in life, had
the same results in view&mdash;the same end to accomplish.
Nor could we help being impressed with the energy
written so strongly on his countenance. His forehead
surmounted by thick, bristly hair, gave additional determination,
to an expressive look, tempered by gleams of
strong feeling. Then we discovered the combination of
great energy, with a deep interest in the welfare of his
fellow-men. When Presten Sundt had read the Chevalier’s
letter, we at once explained that our time was
limited, and we should shortly take the train from Christiania
to Eidsvold. Many were his inquiries about the
English gipsies. The Norwegian gipsies, he said, were
difficult to meet with. Presten Sundt, said a traveller
had called upon him last year when he was from home;
Mrs. Sundt received the visitor, who said he was much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
interested in gipsies, and before he left gave the name of
Viscount Monroe. Presten Sundt showed us the works
he had written, and their practical value cannot be too
highly estimated. Foreseeing the many difficulties, our
small gipsy party might encounter, in a strange country,
Presten Sundt wrote out, signed and sealed a document
which he delivered to us. It was a kind of <i>passe-partout</i>,
requesting his countrymen at all times to give us aid
and assistance, and a kindly reception was ensured. The
name of Presten Eilert Sundt, was so well known, in the
length, and breadth, of Norway’s land, that a few words
were the “open sesame” of our excursion, and possessed
a talismanic value, we must always appreciate. Presten
Eilert Sundt introduced us to Mrs. Sundt and his son.
Coffee was brought in, but, alas! our time had expired.
Preston Sundt regretted our hasty departure, and suddenly
decided to accompany us to the station and bring his son.
We all stepped into the carriage, still in waiting, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
drove towards the station. <i>En route</i> our conversation
was continued upon the subject of gipsies. We suggested,
that in order to utilise the energy, and ability of
the gipsy race, those paths in life, should be selected, in
harmony with their previous habits. The descendants of
generations of tent-dwellers, could not be turned into
<i>kairengroes</i>, or house-dwellers, by a wave of the hand.
Their employment must be consistent with their inborn,
and inherent attachment, to the pure air of heaven. The
rain poured down in torrents, as we drove up to the
station, and entered the <i>salle d’attente</i>. At first we
could not see anything of our people, though the hour of
departure was near at hand. As we waited in the <i>salle
d’attente</i>, Presten Sundt pointed to a map of Norway, hanging
on the wall. It was the “Reisekart over Norges,”
in two sheets. Presten Sundt recommended the map, as
being coloured to indicate the cultivated, and inclosed
portions of the country, so that we could distinguish with
tolerable accuracy, the wild and open districts, likely to
form our most convenient camping-grounds. Whilst
there was yet time, Presten Sundt’s son kindly purchased
one for us.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_056" src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At length we found our cicerone in the left-luggage
office. He had acted the part of pilot, to enable the
gipsies and donkeys to reach the station. The donkeys
had been the centre of considerable interest to the inhabitants
of Christiania that day. Multitudes thronged
on board the <i>Albion</i> steamer. The deck was trodden
and tramped by an animated people, anxious to inspect
the new arrivals. The gipsies must have felt some slight
degree of envy upon the occasion. This curiosity of the
inhabitants was only natural, when we consider that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
they had never seen any donkeys before, and they were
quite as likely to excite special interest, as the hippopotamus
we well remember in the Zoological Gardens,
Regent’s Park. Can we forget the intensity of the
moment, when it rose to the surface of its tank, and its
nose, was distinguished for a few moments above water?
Can we forget the satisfaction of impatient crowds of
visitors, when such an event occurred? If we could
know the discussions respecting our donkeys, they would
doubtless be most instructive&mdash;a tome of literature,
added to the natural history of the animal kingdom.
The animals were pulled about from nose to tail. Their
ears were pulled&mdash;a particular part of the back, was
pressed with the thumb, to gauge their strength; their
mouths opened, their teeth examined, their fore-legs
smoothed down with many hands. One of the sailors
being asked what he called them, answered, “Rabbits,”
and pointing to the “Puru Rawnee,” informed them
that she was the mother of all rabbits. No rest had the
animals, and sorely puzzled they must have been, to
make out what it was all about. The sailors could with
difficulty manage to wash the decks. At length, one,
either by accident, or intention, gave the crowd a sudden
shower-bath with the ship’s hose, bringing forth ejaculations,
which my gipsies did not understand. Multitudes
of pocket-handkerchiefs, removed the moist results, as
our friends precipitately left the vessel.</p>

<p>Our time had been so occupied, that we could not
return to the steamer before the evening train. The
gipsies had remained on board during the day in charge
of the donkeys. They expected us from hour to hour.
Esmeralda informed us afterwards, that they had almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
given us up, we were so long. Before they left for the
railway-station, Mr. T. and the invalid barrister had
been to the steamer to inquire after their master, and
joked them about our absence. “What shall you do,
now your master is gone away?” Upon which Esmeralda
answered, “My word, I shall let him know what
it is staying in this way; I shall speak my mind.” “You
must keep your master under,” said Mr. T. “Yes, I
will,” said Esmeralda, with assumed indignation, which
caused much laughter. Yet, with all her wild spirit,
we had no cause to complain of want of obedience in
Esmeralda. Many long, long miles, we afterwards walked
together, and we must always remember her willing
attention, in our hours of camp life. When our gipsies
saw us at the station, their eyes lighted up with a
thousand smiles.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Albion</i>, a young man offered his services
as an interpreter, or “Tolk,” as they are designated in
Norway. We were afterwards accosted in the street, by
a smart-looking fellow, much more fit for a butler, than
a campaigner, who also wished to accompany us. We
declined their aid, preferring for the present to trust
to our own resources, rather than make any addition to
our party.</p>

<p>Our donkeys, notwithstanding the various opinions
expressed, were allowed to land without any duty being
charged. Mr. Bennett kindly arranged for the railway
tickets, and procured for us the amount of small money
we required. Every traveller is obliged to take a good
supply of small coin. It is not very easy to get change
out of large towns in Norway. Mr. Bennett’s Guide
Book gives complete information as to the various small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
coins in circulation, and their actual value. Some are
depreciated, to less than the amount marked upon them.
Thus: eight-skilling pieces, with the crown and ‘F.R.VI.’
on the reverse, are now only worth six skillings; and
four-skilling pieces, with the same reverse are only worth
three skillings. This is often perplexing at the commencement
of a Norwegian tour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Immediately Presten Sundt caught sight of our
gipsies at the station, he commenced speaking in the
Romany language. He tried their knowledge of Romany
numerals. Noah, we believed, failed at five or six. Their
reckoning powers are not of high order, especially as
they are unable to read and write.</p>

<p>Baudrimont, in his work containing a vocabulary of
the gipsy language, spoken by gipsies wandering in the
French territory of the Basque Provinces, says, the gipsy
women he questioned say “jec” for one, “doui” for two,
and they did not know any higher numeral, using beyond
two, “b8ter” (bouter) signifying “much.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>It is curious to notice, even in one word, the different
methods of spelling, adopted by each author. The Romanes,
not being a written language, and the opportunities
of obtaining it from these wanderers over the
world, being few, each author has struggled into print,
with a vocabulary formed on some phonetic system of
his own. Again, what a different sound, may be given
to a word, by some slight modification of accent, depending
upon the education, and temperament, of the individual
speaking. For instance, if a stranger, unacquainted
with English, but taking an interest in the language,
came to England, for the first time, and wrote down in
his note-book, English words spoken by the less educated
natives, of Hampshire, Staffordshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire,
Gloucestershire, Derbyshire, or Dorsetshire, what
a variation he would find, in the spelling, and pronunciation,
of many words, so collected. It is not,
therefore, singular that gipsy philologists, should differ
in their spelling. It is only extraordinary, that the
accuracy of sound, distinguishing each word, has been so
well conveyed. For example, take the word “much.”
Baudrimont gives b8ter (bouter); Bryant’s collection,
published 1785, gives “bootsee;” Borrow gives Spanish
gipsy “buter” and “butre,” signifying “more.” Most
of the other philologists give “but.” Presten Eilert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Sundt gives “but” in his extensive vocabulary of the
Norwegian Romany. One author (Dr. Bath C. Smart)
gives “booty” and “boot,” and also “kissy.” Our
own gipsies give “koosee” as the Romany for “much.”</p>

<p>Our gipsies seemed to interest Presten Sundt. Noah
and Zacharia were not so dark, as he expected to see
them; Esmeralda seemed quite equal to the standard
of gipsy type. Their ages, and a variety of questions,
were asked in a very short time. Presten Sundt is a
man of much energy, and rapidity of manner, and he
was conversant with the English language.</p>

<p>We were sorry Presten Sundt had not an opportunity
of seeing our tents; they were the same kind as those
used by the gipsies who travel England. Esmeralda
and Zacharia took their places in the second-class compartment,
of the same carriage in which we travelled.
Noah went in the same van with the donkeys.</p>

<p>Presten Sundt and his son, Mr. Bennett, Mr. T., the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
invalid barrister, and our active cicerone sent by the
Chevalier, were assembled on the platform, and wished
us <i>bon voyage</i>, as the train moved out of the station.
Was not one wanting? He may have missed his road.
He was not there&mdash;the Birmingham bagman had been
left behind.

VISITOR&mdash;A RELUCTANT PARTING.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two or three other passengers were seated in our first-class
compartment. The accommodation was very comfortable.
In the carriage, above our seat, there was a
small tap, and drinking-glass, for the supply of deliciously
clear, pure iced water, for the convenience of the thirsty
passenger.</p>

<p>It was after five o’clock when we left Christiania. We
had about fifty-two miles to travel that evening. Our
attention was divided, between conversation, with one of
our fellow-passengers&mdash;a military Norwegian officer&mdash;the
contemplation of the country through which we passed,
and the thoughts of what sort of place, we should have
to camp in that night. The Norwegian officer was an
interesting companion, the <i>paysage</i>, we passed through,
was picturesque, but the idea of our future camp, occupied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
most of our thoughts. We must say, they were very
misty and uncertain. Our fellow-traveller continued with
us longer than any of the other passengers. He had been
in England some time, and was, we believe, an inspector
of the Artillery, possessing a perfect knowledge of the
English language. He told us that the trees in the
forests were often cut down to such an extent, as to be
very detrimental to the climate and shelter required in a
cold country.</p>

<p>Great numbers of the inhabitants were now emigrating
to America. Many sold their farms very cheap, in order
to leave the country. The train stopped once for refreshment,
at a large wooden station, and we had an
opportunity of seeing our gipsies. We passed through
the largest plain in Norway. When we had nearly
arrived at Eidsvold, our fellow-traveller left to visit the
artillery practice-ground. We were then left to muse
over our coming adventures. The train stopped at last
on the side of a large platform.</p>

<p>We were now close to the Mjösen Lake, and had
reached the terminus of the Christiania and Eidsvold
railway. Descending to the platform, we found that
not a person spoke a word of English. With some little
difficulty we got our luggage out, and the donkeys also,
to the astonishment of a small group of people, including
an old man in a white hat. Showers of rain had prevailed
during the route, and we could not see any convenient
camping-ground near the station.</p>

<p>We walked up the platform, and down the platform,
followed by our retinue of three gipsies. The old man
in the white hat continued to watch over us: he followed
us, hovered round us. We tried to converse, but made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
nothing of it; we were unable to understand what he
wanted. At length, seeing a telegraph-office, we sent a
telegram to Mr. Bennett, relative to a coat, and books,
we had left on board the <i>Albion</i>. Most of the small
group of people departed after they had gazed a short
time at the gipsies and donkeys. We could not see any
outlet to our difficulty, or where we were to go for the
night; our provisions were left behind, even if we could
find a convenient camping-ground. At last the old man
took a decided course, and, summoning courage, led off
one of the donkeys, and the other two followed. With
our usual reliance upon results, we let him have his own
way, determined to follow whither he would. Some men,
when they saw us moving off, fastened our baggage on a
small rough hand-cart. In a few minutes, we were
toiling up a steep, winding road, and lost sight of the
railway-station. Then we shortly after arrived at a
large, sloping, open space, shut in by trees and comfortable
wooden buildings, which gave it an air of charming
seclusion. The place was apparently a “skydskift,” and
here seemed to be our destination. The old man went
direct across the open space, in front of the wooden
house, to what appeared a stable, and then halted. The
donkeys were minutely inspected by the people. They
brought some hay and water for our animals, who,
placed in the stable, must have been astonished at their
sudden transition, through such various scenes. We
were then conducted through what appeared to be the
doorway of the “Guest Huus,” into a passage, up some
stairs, into another passage, and through an open doorway
into a very comfortable room. This was a sitting-room,
and also a bed-room, on the first floor. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
were two windows in it, which we put open; a mirror
between them, which our gipsies looked into, as the
shades of night were fast coming upon us. The furniture
consisted of a sofa, and table, some chairs, a bed,
and washing-stand. Up some more stairs, we had
another narrow, but comfortable inner room, with two
more beds.</p>

<p>Saying something about “speise,” coffee and eggs and
most excellent bread and butter were set before us. Our
baggage was deposited in the passage. The gipsies,
Noah and Zacharia, at our request, commenced playing
the violin and tambourine, whilst the evening meal was
being placed on the table. The old man, who came up
with the luggage, still lingered to hear the music. We
seated him on a chair near the door, for we began to look
upon him as our guardian angel. The comely-looking
“pige,” or girl-in-waiting, at length seated us at table, as
we set our musical-box to play. They had probably
never heard one. There was a charming stillness about
the place, broken by those liquid modulations of harmony,
which seemed to create a thousand impressions, and
agreeable sensations. Then we found ourselves taking
our quiet evening meal with our three gipsies, who,
to do them justice, passed muster wonderfully well.
Esmeralda had the small sofa. After all the hurry,
worry, and bustle of the day, as we sipped our coffee, we
could not help feeling thankfulness to the Giver of all
things, peace with all men, and content with the world.
Our repast ended, the musical box ceased to play, the
old man, bowing, retired. The kind-hearted looking
girls prepared the beds. Esmeralda had the best bed, in
the sitting-room; Zacharia, one made up for the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
on the sofa; Noah and myself, the two beds in the
narrow inner room. The beds were a serious business
to Noah and Zacharia. Noah could not find his road
into bed. At length, with our guidance, he was
initiated into the mysteries; the result was almost
immediate sleep. With the windows all open, and not
a sound to disturb the stillness of night, we were not
long, before we became unconscious of all toil and
trouble.</p>

<p>Never shall we forget Zacharia in his bed, as we
looked into the sitting-room the next morning. High
above the sofa, one naked foot protruded, somewhere
trailing near the floor we noticed some straggling locks
of black hair, belonging to a head, whilst all the bed-clothes
were tied, twisted, tumbled, and rolled into every
conceivable shape.</p>

<p>We had an early “frokost” (breakfast)&mdash;excellent
coffee, eggs, bread, and butter, People are moving early
in Norway. It was a fine, beautiful morning: gipsies
must be employed, and the violin and tambourine were
again in requisition, whilst we sat on the sofa, at our
small table, writing up our diary. The servants came
up occasionally, and listened to the music, as they stood
at the open doorway of our room. So the morning
passed in delightful rest and tranquillity. Who could be
otherwise than happy, with such <i>honnêtes gens</i>? Everything
was so clean and tidy. Our “middags mad”
(dinner, or midday meal) was served, at our request, at
one o’clock. It is astonishing how a small stock of words,
will enable you to supply your wants, in a foreign land.
Yet we did not look upon Norway as foreign to us; all
was so homely, that we felt at home with everything, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
everybody. Possibly some of our very remote ancestors
may have been Norwegians. We were soon quietly
seated at our “middags mad” with our gipsies. A dish
of mutton côtelettes, with bacon, very good potatoes, and
two small glasses of “baiersk öl”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> (bottled ale), completed
our fare. The ale is peculiar in taste, but sparkling and
clear; like some of the Australian colonial ale, it is not
to be taken in any quantity with impunity.</p>

<p>After our dinner, Esmeralda decided to put on her new
dress. She had one faded, worn frock, which she wore
under her Alpine cloak. Her wardrobe being so limited,
we had bought her a blue dress, at no great cost, before
leaving England, and her mother made it up. In order
that she should not be different from the Norwegian
style of ornamentation, we purchased some plain silver
buttons. They were stitched on in front, and at the
cuffs, on a Scotch plaid braid, which trimmed the dress,
and was the selection of her mother. We were rather
amused, as we looked up from our writing, to see her
descend from the inner room, where she had completed
her toilette. The silver buttons were resplendent on the
dark plaid braid. The dress was made according to
the gipsy fashion. We thought her mother might have
allowed her a little more skirt, and the bodice was rather
close-fitting&mdash;scarcely room enough for development.
Esmeralda had naturally a wonderfully small waist, and
the dress was so made that it seemed quite tight all the
way down before, being more ample behind. There was
no concealment of legs; she had put on some coloured
stockings, and her Alpine slippers, which we had given
her to rest her feet occasionally when she took off the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
heavy boots so much admired by Mr. T. She had no
reason to be ashamed of her foot and ankle. Her dark,
raven hair was natural; no wretched chignon, and masses
of false hair, distorted nature&mdash;there was no deception,
truth was represented, reality was without a rival.
Esmeralda we shall always remember as she then appeared
in the guest chamber of beautiful Eidsvold. One
of our attentive servants came up soon afterwards, and
was apparently astonished at the sudden change to the
gorgeous apparel she beheld. The transformation was
as complete as one of those changes we read of in the
old tales of enchantment. The “pige” did not stay long,
but silently departed, and soon after returned, with
another of our attendants, who gazed with a curious air
of interest at what she saw. The old man soon came
up, and occasionally stood in the passage. Sometimes he
spoke&mdash;we did not understand him; then he would take
off his hat, bow, and retire, whilst we continued our
writing. We now discovered, to our annoyance, that the
guitar had been left behind. Zacharia was certain he
had seen it on board the <i>Albion</i>. We began to think we
should never be able to get our things together, and sent
a telegram to Mr. Bennett, from the station, saying that
our things had been put on board the steamer, and to ask
him to kindly send us a copy of Murray’s Guide Book.
We were anxious to be well prepared with all information.
Then we received a note addressed to us by name,
but Mr. Bennett, not knowing where we were, and possibly
supposing us camped on the shore of the Mjösen
Lake, had, to insure its delivery, added, “Den Herre som
reiste igaaraftes med 3 œsler,” meaning the gentleman
travelling last night with three donkeys.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>It appeared that two packages had been found. Three
others, Mr. Bennett said, were probably in the hold of the
vessel; and Captain Soulsby had reported several odds
and ends, left in our cabin to be forwarded. We were
almost <i>au désespoir</i>.</p>

<p>My gipsies must do something; so the violin, tambourine,
and castanettes, again sounded in a maze of
polkas and waltzes. At times a succession of visitors
came up, and stood in the passage to hear the music, but
we could hold no converse with them. At last we had
coffee, eggs, and bread and butter. What coffee! We
often wonder how it is we so seldom have in England
anything which represents the name. In France, Germany,
Norway, and Denmark you have excellent coffee
almost everywhere. Our gipsies had managed wonderfully
well. Zacharia did once upset the contents of his
cup of coffee over the white cloth. We made them use
their napkins, and restrained as much as possible the use
of the knives, at times, when the fork was the proper
vehicle to the mouth. Much nervousness was in consequence
avoided. As we were lounging over our coffee,
our guardian angel, the old man, came up, and bowing,
murmured something about Herre wanted to see us.
Who could want to see us? Probably some matter
connected with our baggage, which was strongly associated
at that time with every idea. We went down
soon afterwards, and entered the next house under the
same roof. A stout, portly, nice-looking man in uniform
took off his hat, and said a very good English “Good
evening, sir.” He was captain of the lake steamer,
leaving the next morning for Lillehammer. The captain
wished to know whether we were going next morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
He was also anxious to see the donkeys. Taking him
with us to the stable, he said he would have a box ready
to sling them on board, and they must be down at the
place of embarkation, near the station at nine o’clock.
We said they should be there, and that we should have
much pleasure in going by his steamer, and avail ourselves
of his knowledge of English. Wishing good evening,
he strolled off to take a bath, in the large wooden
bath-house, on the side of the lake below.</p>

<p>Returning to our room, we continued our diary. Noah
informed us at dinner, that he had put by an engagement
of £1 a week, offered by some farmer, in order that he
might accompany us. Much thankfulness was expressed
at so much self-sacrifice, and it was the subject of many
a quiet joke during our journey. How pleasantly the
time passed. How smiling life seemed in the retirement
of Eidsvold. Again Zacharia struck up his violin;
again Noah executed a clever roulade on his tambourine.
More visitors occasionally appeared, and disappeared.
Then we sent Noah and Zacharia down to the station, to
see if any of our baggage had come by the last train, and
we were fortunate enough to receive four packages,
including our guitar, and one package by Captain
Soulsby. The case of provisions could not be found.
Our telegrams increased. We hoped to get the case
next morning before the steamer left Eidsvold. In the
stillness of the closing evening, we sang with the guitar,
our gipsy song. One of our attendants was most
certainly in love with Noah. We had generally sent him
to the other house, to ask for whatever we wanted. It
was practice for him, and no doubt he had made a
conquest. About ten o’clock the attendants made up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the bed on the sofa, and we gave them another last air
before we retired. Well we remember the look our
clean, tidy, and comely “pige” gave Noah, as he played
his tambourine with an energy of feeling peculiar to the
gipsy race. “Cushty ratty” (gip., good-night) to all, and
we were soon asleep.</p>

<p>It is light at an early hour in Norway. We were up
at four o’clock, a number of letters were written. At six
o’clock it was found that Esmeralda had one eye nearly
swollen up. A musketo had lounged in, through the
open window in the night. It was natural that he
should be attracted by her dark eyes, but he should
have been satisfied, with distant contemplation. I was
called in as the “cushty drabengro” (gip., good doctor),
and by the aid of some glycerine rendered the bite less
painful.</p>

<p>The rest were soon up. We had found Zacharia in
some extraordinary complication of bed-clothes on the
sofa. I think he was glad to regain tent life, for this
was the last time he slept off the ground during his stay
in Norway.</p>

<p>“Frokost” was served at seven o’clock&mdash;coffee, eggs,
bread and butter. As usual, all excellent. The bread, we
understood, was sent from Christiania to Eidsvold. The
morning was lovely&mdash;our spirits almost irrepressible.
Esmeralda poured out the coffee&mdash;“del the moro” (gip.)
“give us the bread,” Romany and English sparkled on
the board.</p>

<p>After “frokost” we repacked some of our baggage,
and Esmeralda brushed our coat. The bright anticipation
of a delightful trip along the Mjösen Lake, and the
probability of our case of provisions coming by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
morning train, in time for the steamer, had quite banished
all melancholy. Noah and Zacharia gave one or two
tunes after breakfast as a farewell, whilst the comely
“pige” gazed at Noah in speechless wonder. She
stood all spell bound. We fear the gipsy’s eyes, for
they had scarcely any other medium of conversation, had
wrought much mischief. Some man appeared at the
open doorway, with his knife at his side, and seeming
transfixed, so completed the tableau. Time flew on with
rapid wing. Noah and Zacharia departed with the
donkeys. We had more time; and as we sat on the
sofa, waiting for our account, we took our guitar, and
sang our last song at Eidsvold, “Welcome, you dear old
land.”

<p>Our bill was moderate&mdash;four dollars, four marks, and
eight skillings; twenty-four skillings for attendance
seemed quite sufficient. Our things were all placed on
a truck; Esmeralda carried Zacharia’s violin, our guitar,
and our two extra caps, whilst we took our courier-bags,
and, under our arm, in two satchels made for them,
the two Regent-street tambourines. Our appearance
certainly much resembled travelling musicians.</p>

<p>Bidding adieu to the kind people of the house, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
were soon descending the winding road to the steamer.
As we walked along, we could not help alluding to the
astonishment our numerous friends would express if they
could see us. Noah and Zacharia soon after met us;
they had left the donkeys at the railway-station, and
came to say the provisions had not arrived. When we
reached the station, another telegram was sent, in which
we mentioned Hudson Brothers, as consignors to Messrs.
Wilson. The clerk of the telegraph office began to
regard us as an habitué of the bureau, and we looked
upon him as a pupil in the English language. We were
astonished at his progress, and he was apparently equally
so at our large expenditure of money in telegrams.
Rather in mournful mood, we went to the wooden
platform to which the steamer was moored. There was
the box; there stood the donkeys; there the men to
put them into the box, and the sling, to sling them on
board. How are the donkeys to be put into the box?
Vain were the efforts made&mdash;all to no purpose; the
donkeys had made up their minds. At last, with the
united efforts of four men, and Noah, one by one they
were pulled, dragged, lifted, carried, forced, in wild resistance,
over the passenger’s bridge, and along the deck,
in sight of the astonished lookers-on. The “Puru
Rawnee” and his companions were at length safely
placed before the windlass on the fore-deck, close to
four brass guns, ready loaded for a salute. We decided
to go to Christiania, in search of the provisions, and
sent another telegram to Mr. Bennett. The passage-money
of our gipsies, and the three donkeys to Lillehammer,
amounted to five dollars, seventeen marks; we
also paid six marks for our gipsies’ dinner, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
one bottle of “Baiersk Öl” between them, and a cup of
coffee each. The captain kindly promised to look after
them, and arrange for them to camp, when they got to
Lillehammer. Just before leaving, we gave them some
Norsk words for bread, cheese, coffee, &amp;c. The old man
in the white hat, our guardian angel, was, of course, at
hand. With much anxiety he wrote down the words
for Noah. Unfortunately, Noah could not read; but
as the old man pronounced each word aloud, Noah
followed, and the old man did not suspect, apparently,
the neglected education of his pupil.</p>

<p>There was the sound of the coming train, just before
eleven; down came the passengers, hurrying with their
things to the steamer. There was the officer, and his
wife, with the Tyrolese hat and feather&mdash;we had met
again. Their two carrioles<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> are put on board&mdash;hasty
salutations&mdash;we learn that the invalid barrister has left
Christiania for Bergen&mdash;they are going to Gjövik. We
told him our dilemma, and he said we had hurried too
quickly through Christiania. They had been busy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
making purchases at Christiania. Our conversation now
ceases, for the steamer must depart. The stout captain
took up his position on the steamer’s pont, and, taking
out his watch, he gave the signal for starting. As the
<i>Dronningen</i> glided along the still waters of the Mjösen,
our “cushty chavos” (gip., good children) made farewell
signals to their Romany Rye.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_078" src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NORWEGIAN FENCE.</p></div>

<p>Another telegram to Mr. Bennett, to say we should be
in Christiania at seven o’clock in the evening, no train
leaving Eidsvold before the afternoon. The telegraph
clerk expressed his astonishment at the number of our
telegrams, and increased his stock of English. We felt
lonely away from our people. It was a very warm day,
and we had some hours on hand. Crossing the bridge at
the head of the lake, near the railway station, we passed
the houses on the opposite side, and walked along the
dusty narrow road beyond. We could see nothing but
inclosures on either side the road. The common style
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of Norwegian road fence consists of posts, with two long
parallel rails, supporting a number of slanting rails, of
shorter length, loosely placed between them.</p>

<p>There was no shade. The wooden log houses, here
and there, had generally tiled roofs. No attempt was
made at ornament or picturesque effect. Everything in
the rough. We sat on the narrow road side, and noted
up our diary; then we returned to the houses again near
the bridge, and being hungry, boldly walked into one
which bore some resemblance to a place of refreshment.
They civilly said they had nothing, and that there was a
house on the hill, beyond the station, where refreshment
might be had. They meant the house at which we had
lately stayed.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> It was about half-past two o’clock when
we again crossed the bridge, and called at the telegraph
office. The polite clerk seemed rather pleased to see
us, at the same time handing a telegram with much
alacrity.</p>

<p>A life-boat on the ocean to the shipwrecked mariner,
could not have given much greater pleasure. The provisions
had been found. Our name was not on the case,
but our mention of Messrs. Hudson Brothers, as consignors,
had fortunately furnished the clue. They would
reach Eidsvold that night. With some degree of satisfaction
we soon ascended the hill, and came to our quiet
retreat. The comely “pige” welcomed us&mdash;she seemed
much pleased&mdash;and we were shown into a finer, and more
stately chamber, than the one we had before occupied.
We were hungry, and our dinner was quickly served.
Côtelettes, potatoes, and some kind of sweet dish, with
some “Baiersk Öl.” Then we wrote letters at a table

near the window, in View of the Mjösen Lake. All
was quietude; we felt as if we were lost. At six
o’clock our thermometer was 82° Fahrenheit. We
determined to take a Badekar (bath). The large wooden
bath-house was at a short distance below the
“gjœstgiver-gaard.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_080" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NORWEGIAN BATH-ROOM.</p></div>

<p>Crossing over a light wooden bridge from the lake
shore, we were immediately on a balcony extending round
the building, above the waters of the lake. Doors opened
from the balcony into the bath-rooms. Each visitor has
a small dressing-room adjoining another small room, in
which stands a zinc bath. As we looked in, a curious
leather spout pendant from the ceiling supplied the water
to the bath. It was a clumsy contrivance, and out of
repair; part of the water poured in streams on the floor,
whilst the other portion found its way into the bath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_081" src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The man in attendance, who came to prepare the bath,
could not understand what heat we required, especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
as they use Reaumur, and we use the Fahrenheit thermometer.
A Norwegian gentleman, just taking his bath,
and very scantily clothed, at the request of the man,
politely came to the bath-room door to act as interpreter.
He spoke some English, and kindly relieved us from our
difficulty. Thanking him for his aid, he bowed and
retired. The price of our bath was fivepence. Giving
the attendant a few skillings, we returned to our pleasant
room at the quiet “gjœstgiver-gaard.” How dreamy we
felt at eve, as we watched from our window the lights
and shadows on the Lake Mjösen. A gilded surface in
the evening sun&mdash;how full of beauty&mdash;one seemed to
view the imagery of other worlds. There is in nature
more than art can tell, or language render. Not a leaf
but has its history, a flower its tale, nor a sound without
its music to the mind. There were some quaint old
paintings on the panels of the chamber, which caught
our attention as we sat musing there, and we hastily
sketched them. One represented a priest in old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
clerical costume walking unconsciously as he reads, into
a river, or out to sea. The priest is saying, as he reads:
“Jeg maa gaae til Bunden i dette Problem for jeg gaae
vidre.” (I must go to the bottom of this problem before
I go farther.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_082" src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The other painting represented a stout clergyman
who is being rowed along a lake or river. He is so stout
that the end of the boat in which he sits is nearly under
water. He is supposed to be shouting to the boatman:</p>

<p>“Hal’ud manne. Der gaa er Dampen.” (Pull away,
lad! There goes the steamer.)</p>

<p>With our mind much at ease we retired early to rest.
By some chance they put us to sleep in Esmeralda’s bed.
We rose at four o’clock the next morning, and wrote
letters. Our “frokost” was served at seven o’clock. It
was a beautiful morning: our comely “pige” was there,
but she had no gipsy Noah to admire. We paid our
account&mdash;three marks sixteen skillings. Slinging our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
courier-bag over our shoulder, as we gave the comely
“pige” a douceur, we again wished these kind and
attentive people farewell. It must be owned that we
lingered for a moment near this quiet retreat, so full
of pleasant moments and long-to-be-remembered reminiscences.</p>

<p>At the railway-station the case of provisions, which
had arrived, cost us one dollar. Sealing our letters in
the telegraph office, we posted them. The case of provisions,
which was very heavy, was brought down to the
steamer, and placed on the jetty to be taken on board.
We then noticed, fastened to it, a letter from Mr. Bennett,
and Hudson Brothers’ receipted bill, attached outside
the case. It appeared that some of the packages in
the case had burst open. Pea-flour, wheat-flour, salt, and
other contents had got mixed and spread about in wild
confusion. Mr. Bennett had kindly had the pea-flour
and salt put into a bag. Great care is requisite in packing
for long journeys. The provisions were all right at last.
Paying another visit to the telegraph office, we remitted
to Mr. Bennett a sum sufficient to cover all costs incidental
to the baggage and expenses, and also wrote
a letter to him. We must ever acknowledge his kind
attention. Mr. Bennett’s services are invaluable to new
arrivals; ten minutes’ conversation with him will often
save the tourist days of trouble, vexation, and delay.
You have, also, the feeling that he is a gentleman, and
you can trust his advice. Our telegraph clerk was
wonderfully polite, and we felt a certain amount of regret
when for the last time we wished him good morning.
As we left the office, he said, in very good English,
“I think, sir, you are now all right.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>We returned to the steamer, which left Eidsvold at
half-past eleven in the forenoon.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The passengers were
for the most part plainly dressed, and of the class of small
farmers. The men wore large, ample trousers, and thick,
heavy Wellington boots. The excursion along the lake
was delightful. The Mjösen is sixty-three English miles
in length. On the shores of the lake, the steamer passed
numerous farms and pleasant homesteads, with pine and
fir forests forming a distant background. Towards Lillehammer
the scenery becomes more picturesque; the landing
stations often reminded us of colonial settlements.
Then we became acquainted with a young passenger and
his friend who were going to Lillehammer. The friend
spoke a few words of English. A tall, smart-looking
young Norwegian officer, neatly dressed in plain clothes,
who had travelled in England, France, and Prussia, spoke
English fluently. Whilst we were conversing, an old
man came up with a number of knives to sell; they were
suspended to a wire. After some inspection, we selected
two knives at six marks each, and one at one dollar.
Then came the money payment; it was a serious business.
We produced a handful of those varied coins,
many not counting for the value they are marked. A
young man who spoke a few words of English volunteered
to count out the sum. The countenance of the
old man gazing on my money, and the young man, who
was anxious to be exact to a skilling, would have made
a good subject for Frith, or some artist skilful in making
a group on canvas convey its own wordless history. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
hunting-knives were intended as presents to our gipsies.
Although the only Englishmen on board, with such
homely, kind people, we felt as with friends, and they
seemed to give us welcome to their beautiful land. As
we surveyed the Lake scene, the <i>Dronningen</i> steamed in
sight. Our friend the captain took off his hat in salutation
to our captain and passengers. When we were returning
his greeting he seemed to recognise us, and again waved
his hat in final adieu. The <i>Dronningen</i> is said to be the
best steamer on the lake. What a strange exhilaration
we felt as we inhaled the pure lake breeze, whilst the
steamer glided along the waters of the Mjösen. We had
no care. The moments seemed an existence of perfect
enjoyment, with only a short span dividing us from our
tents, and people, and first Norwegian camp, whence we
should wander over many leagues of nature’s fairest
scenes. On the shores of the lake, to our right, stand
the ruins of Stor Hammer cathedral, forming some picturesque
arches, in broken decay, nearly all that remains of
a once noble pile destroyed in 1567. At this part of the
lake, George Bidder, once renowned as the calculating
boy, whose wonderful memory and rapid calculations we
had often read of in days gone by, had purchased an
estate.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>Although there are not many castles in Norway, on
the island of Helgëo are the ruins of a fortress built by
Hako IV. The old church of Ringsaker, on the eastern
shore of the lake, is said to possess an altar curiously
carved, and also the body of a priest, singularly preserved
from the ruthless hand of time.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The old church is said
to stand on the battle-field where St. Olaf gained one of
his many victories, and adds one more interesting association
to the shores of the Mjösen.</p>

<p>Dinner on board the steamer is announced as “fertig”
(ready). It was not a table d’hôte consisting of many
dishes, but a substantial meal of fish, meat, and a Norwegian
dish, of which milk formed a large ingredient.
As we afterwards lounged on deck, the Norwegian officer
looked over our song, gave us some hints of pronunciation
of Norsk words, and said the English verses were
well translated into Norwegian. The song, with its
engraved bordure of gipsy life and Norwegian scenery,
seemed to interest him very much; and before he left
at Hammer he was much pleased with the copy we
presented for his acceptance.</p>

<p>One large island, in the lake, we were told, was the
most fertile in Norway. The shores of the lake are not
very far distant from each other. All was sunshine, with
a strong breeze upon the lake. How changed the scene
in winter. One of the passengers told us the winter
continued eight months, sometimes even nine months.
The days in summer are often very warm, and the nights
cold. The homesteads had no pretensions to Swiss
decoration; and the villages had a similar appearance to
a new settlement in Australia. Without the forest trees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Norway would soon be a sterile spot. Take the timber
from the mountains, and all would be a barren, cheerless
wilderness of rocks and stones. It is to be hoped that
government will one day restrain the rapid destruction
of the forests. Even in England the shady lanes are
fast vanishing before the close-cropped hedge-rows;
barely a fence which is considered necessary in this
utilitarian age. The birds, which once found shelter and
convenience for building their nests, are diminishing
fast, and one must often listen in vain for their cheerful
song.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The steamer passed a very picturesque rocky island
towards Lillehammer. Only one traveller now remained
who spoke English, and his stock was limited, consisting
of two words. Fortunately, we arranged with the steward
for a stock of three bottles of brandy, and two or three
bottles of St. Jullien claret, before the officer who spoke
English left the vessel. We paid one dollar for our fare,
and three dollars one mark and eight skillings for dinner,
coffee, ale, bread and cheese, three bottles of brandy, and
two of claret. We tried in vain to pass an English sovereign,
to economise our small coin. The steward spoke
a little English. He was a jolly-looking, buzzy, fuzzy,
smick-smack, smooth, straight up-and-down, and no
mistake, sort of fellow. He did his best to assist us.
We soon steamed up to the wooden pier below Lillehammer.
Noah was standing between our two tents,
pitched on a rise of ground, above a wooden building by
the pier. Noah saw us at once, and came down to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
pier as jauntily as possible, with a pipe, to our great
surprise, stuck in his mouth.</p>

<p>Waiting until the passengers had gone on shore, we
called Noah on board, and gave him the bottles to carry
to our tents. The case was slung on to the pier. The
steward referred to the captain, who spoke English, and
decided that the amount we had already paid included
carriage to Lillehammer. They wished us good-by, and
we left the vessel. A porter from one of the hotels, who
came to us, placed the case on a truck, and we told him
to take it up to our tents. Esmeralda came forward as
we approached the camp. The gipsies were much pleased
to see us again. Esmeralda said she knew we were on
the steamer. Whilst we were talking, we caught sight
of the truck and case going up the road from the lake
to the town of Lillehammer. Noah and ourselves went
after it, and soon after Noah and the porter brought it to
the tents. The case was a large wooden box of considerable
weight. With much satisfaction we contemplated
its arrival in camp. The tents were now actually pitched
on the shore of the beautiful Mjösen Lake. Its calm
waters, lovely in the eventide, and the quietude of nature,
gave us one more glimpse of perfect happiness.

<p>The Mjösen is a fine lake. The scenery is not bold,
or imposing in wild and rugged outline, but it is beautiful
and pleasing. There is a richness often wanted in the
wilder scenes of nature. Our contemplation must be
short; we have work to do. Noah with my Tennant’s
geological hammer soon began to loosen the nails of the
provision-case. A crowd of boys, who gathered round,
and the tall man in the background, rendered the group
of spectators a complete study; there was an expression
of deep interest as Noah loosened every nail. Our
gipsies had been well cared-for by the gallant captain of
the <i>Dronningen</i>. He had kindly arranged for our
people to pitch their tents on some waste ground near
the lake; the woman of the house above seemed to
exercise a sort of right over it, and had agreed to supply
our people with food at the house. She was an energetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
old woman, with not a very good-tempered expression
of countenance, but she had been very attentive.</p>

<p>The captain had on the previous evening taken our
gipsies in a boat across the lake. They had spent the
evening very pleasantly with himself and wife. Some
sympathy was expressed for the separation of Esmeralda
from her husband, referring to myself. The gipsies, we
afterwards understood, had a gay time on board the
<i>Dronningen</i>; they played at the captain’s request, who
collected quite a fortune for them. Noah and Zachariah<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
were also treated to cigars, and various liquids by the
passengers. Their voyage on the Mjösen Lake seemed
to have been unusually gay. Once more we were in
camp, and the boys from the town above kept accumulating
round our tents. Then we went up the road
towards Lillehammer with our maps, and examined
the route, and the direction ready for our journey next
morning. When we returned, it was eight o’clock.
There were so many people about, that Esmeralda and
myself went up to the woman’s house to have coffee.
Noah and Zachariah afterwards took their turn whilst
we stayed at the tents. Noah had our instructions to
pay the woman, but he was quite unable to regulate the
account. We found the old woman, who was exceedingly
polite, charged us three dollars for our coffee that
evening, and a day and a half board for our gipsies, and
the use of the waste ground. The charge was nearly as
much as we had paid at the comfortable inn at Eidsvold,
with lodgings for a longer period. The gipsies had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
promised her some music; and as we were anxious to
pass the time until the people should disperse, Esmeralda
and Zachariah came up to play one or two tunes. We
had an upstairs room, very bare of furniture, containing
only a small table and sofa and two or three chairs.
Esmeralda sat on the sofa, and myself and Zacharia at
each end of the table. Away went the violin and the tambourine,
waltzes and polkas, in rapid succession. The old
woman walked about in an ecstacy. Very shortly afterwards
a large crowd of both sexes appeared at the doors
of the room, and we motioned for them to dance or sit
down. In came the steward of the steamer, smoking a
cigar, and the cashier with him. Bang, bang, went the
tambourine. Esmeralda, with her dark eyes flashing, was
no mean tambourinist. With regard to dancing they
seem very diffident. Chairs were brought, and the
steward and cashier were accommodated. The former
smoked, and seemed on the best of terms with himself
and everybody else. He was a good-humoured, good-tempered
fellow, and pressed us to have something to
drink. Notwithstanding we declined, in came the
woman of the house with two bottles of beer and glasses
for us. The bottles were uncorked and the steward
came to pour out the beer; but although he pressed us
to take some, and also to allow our gipsies to do so, we
were firm in our determination. With an air of almost
disappointment that we did not accept their hospitality,
he returned to his seat. Jingle, jingle, went the brasses
of the tambourine. The room, and passages to it
became quite thronged. The steward smoked; the
cashier seemed, we thought, to look with apparent admiration
at our tambourinist. We had evidently an appreciative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
audience. The assemblage reminded us, as
we sat there in quiet contemplation, of one of those
foreign scenes at times represented in dramas in London.
Gipsies, foreign costumes, log-house, landlady, peasants
with knives at their sides, steward of steamer and
cashier, wild strip of broken ground below the house,
tents, donkeys, steamer, and the lake beautiful with the
shadow of declining day&mdash;all the elements of romance
were there, and it was a reality.</p>

<p>We looked at our watch: it was nearly ten. We
rose, and passing through the visitors wished them good
evening, and were soon seated in our tents. Group after
group of people came thronging down, taking a cursory
glance, as they passed, as if unwilling to intrude. We
were busy arranging and packing our things for the
next morning: some would now and then peep in; one
went so far as to take hold of our tent carpet and
examine it. Another laid hold of our iron kettle-prop
outside, and it was amusing to see the earnest discussion
that was going on as to its use. An intelligent man
with a benign smile made a motion with it, as if making
holes in the ground, and whilst pointing to the tent-rods
looked at us for confirmation. He was evidently much
gratified by our nod of assent. The centre of attraction
were the donkeys; party after party from Lillehammer
swept by our tents along the broken ground, to the spot
where our donkeys stood. They were examined with an
earnestness which showed our friends to be warmly
attached to the subject of natural history. The steward
came up to our tents, soon after we left the house, and
pressed us to come with him on board the steamer, but
we declined; whereupon he took off his hat and left.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
The goods porter of the steamer wandered about our
tents for some time, and at last came up and said he
wanted half a dollar more for the carriage of the case.
When we took out our money to pay him, he said it was
a dollar. Perhaps we misunderstood him at first. The
captain had said we had nothing more to pay; but, not
having any time to investigate the matter, we trusted
to the proverbial honesty of the Norwegians, and so paid
the dollar required. Taking advantage of a lull in the
number of the visitors, as it was becoming late, the case
was unpacked. Then more visitors came; but we went
on and repacked our provisions in our bags, for carriage
the next morning on our donkeys. Some of the lookers-on
near our tents criticised our biscuits, and especially
our pea-flour which was scattered over everything.
They did so good humouredly, and seemed astonished at
our stores. Zachariah launched the empty case on the
lake below. Our visitors at last became few in number,
and less frequent.</p>

<p>Esmeralda carefully packed up her dress with the
silver buttons. She had hung it on a bush near the
tents after they had arrived at Lillehammer. The blue
dress and the silver buttons gleaming in the sun must
have been a pleasing sight. At last we went to bed;
that is, we retired to sleep on our waterproof rug and
carpet within our tent partition. The indistinct sound
of voices outside our tents and the noise of persons who
appeared to be wandering about the donkeys still continued,
but we were all soon asleep: The thermometer
had been at 86° Fahrenheit in the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hum of a small mosquito awoke us at about two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
o’clock in the morning; at half-past two o’clock we
roused our gipsies. The things were soon packed on the
donkeys by Noah, who was an excellent packer. We
finally struck our camp at three o’clock <small>A.M.</small> The house
where our coffee had been supplied the previous evening
was shut up, and wrapt in silence; the woman of the house
was possibly slumbering with the three dollars under
her pillow. The steamer lay moored at the wooden
pier, where the steward and cashier, if they slept on
board, may have been dreaming of the dark-eyed gitana.</p>

<p>How silent all seemed in the early morning on the
banks of the Mjösen Vand. Not a soul stirring, save one
solitary fisherman in his boat in the far distance upon the
lake. With our Alpine stocks, tents, and baggage,
donkeys and gipsies, we slowly ascended the road to
Lillehammer. How delightful in the freshness of the
early morning to commence our nomadic wandering of
many days. Laing says, in his excellent work on Norway,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
“A young and clever English sportsman, especially
if he had a taste, also, for any branch of natural
history, ought to pass a summer very agreeably with his
rifle, fishing-rod, and his tent, among the fjelde and lakes,
encamping where fancy and sport might lead him, and
carry all his accommodation on a couple of ponies.”</p>

<p>As we passed through the town of Lillehammer we
noticed that most of the windows were shut; the inhabitants
were enjoying their morning sleep. We felt
thankful that we carried our home with us. Lillehammer
is not without its associations; its former cathedral and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
monastery were originally founded by an Englishman,
Nicholas Breakspear, in 1160. He was afterwards Pope
Hadrian IV. As we passed down the long street, one
man was on the look-out; with hot haste he rushed to
the back of the house, as if to apprise some one else of
our coming; he returned as we were going by, and said
“Ya, ya!” when we asked if we were in the right road for
Holmen; then standing in the street, he gazed after us
until we were out of sight.</p>

<p>With feelings of bright anticipation we had entered the
long and fertile valley of the Gudbrandsdalen.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Commencing
at Lillehammer, the valley of Gudbransdalen
extends 168 miles to the foot of Dovre Fjeld. Our route
is on the right bank of the Logen. Many cultivated
farms occupy the lower portions of the often narrow
valley on each side of the main road, while hills and pine
woods rise above them on either side.</p>

<p>We all felt particularly hungry as we pushed on for
some distance along a good road on the right of the
river Logen. Coming to a small stream of water on the
road-side, we partly unloaded our donkeys; on a small
space of rough ground the gipsies lighted a fire, and
prepared our breakfast of tea, sardines, and college
biscuits. One large carriage and pair passed us <i>en route</i>
for Lillehammer; a pony with carriole was tied behind it,
and all were jogging along at a comfortable pace, with
the occupants fast asleep. Noah commenced repacking
our donkeys, when a timber cart passed with two
men upon it; one wore a red cap. They stopped and
scanned our donkeys with curious eyes; then they
wished to know why we did not use the donkeys to draw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
a carriage. The man in the red cap offered Esmeralda a
seat on his timber, which, though kindly meant, was not
accepted. They went on before us, and evidently made
known our coming, for from time to time men and
women rushed up to the fences on the road-side to look
at our cavalcade;&mdash;it was a very picturesque one, including
Zachariah almost fast asleep on one of the loaded
donkeys. As we proceeded we were overtaken by a
carriage, in which we recognised the inn porter who had
assisted us with our case from the steamer. The two
travellers in the carriage had been our fellow-passengers
by the steamer on the Mjösen; they took off their hats.
Another carriage afterwards followed, and another steam-boat
passenger took off his hat and recognised us again.
We were now some miles from Lillehammer, and Noah
was sent to try a roadside house for bread; the woman,
who spoke a little English, recommended a house beyond.
Coming soon after to an old road leading below the new
main route&mdash;along the edge a deep declivity covered with
trees and bushes, which formed the lofty bank of the
rapid foaming river Logen&mdash;we halted. We were in
sight of the falls called the Hunnefos. The river is
broad and rapid; and the falls, although not of great
height, are nevertheless picturesque. Above the old
road an embankment of loose stones sloped up to the
main route, which was not very far above us, although
overlooked from the road; the spot now overgrown with
short turf was sufficiently level and out of the way for
our camp. We were all rather sleepy, and wanted rest;
the day had become very hot. Esmeralda had not felt very
well; a very small quantity of quinine helped her on the
journey. Having decided to remain here, the donkeys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
were driven down the old road for a short distance.
From this spot we had a beautiful view of the falls; our
camp was probably not far from the station of Aronsveen.
It was delightful to lounge among our baggage after we
had unpacked. The road being a sort of cul-de-sac, we
left the donkeys to ramble below. Noah went in search
of bread and butter to a farm-house, and procured a small
loaf and half a pound of butter, for one mark and a half;
the loaf was black bread and small. Several very heavy
showers came on, but our light siphonia waterproof from
Edmiston’s kept all our things perfectly dry. Dinner
was prepared at about one o’clock; a case of the
Australian cooked mutton was opened: with some hesitation
we had added Australian meat to our commissariat;
we had ventured to take it, like the skater who tries the
ice for the first time. Our sardine-opener in the form of
a fish, which cost 6<i>d.</i>, soon gave us access to the tin of
meat. All pronounced the Australian preserved mutton
excellent. Esmeralda, who had been very sleepy and not
very well, though revived by the quinine, did not entirely
recover until after dinner. A bottle of claret was shared
amongst us. It was our first day in camp, and our rule
of no stimulants or smoking allowed was not rigidly enforced.
Two songs with the guitar enlivened the party;
then a duet, violin and guitar; afterwards a duet, violin
and tambourine; finale, all the instruments together.
Noah was chaffed as usual. The sun became so hot after
dinner, that we could scarcely bear our terrace, placed as
we were at the foot of an embankment of loose bare
rocks. The donkeys escaped and went towards Lillehammer.
Noah had fallen asleep, but starting up in a
sort of stupor, at length succeeded in bringing them back.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Some of the people passing along the main route stopped
to gaze at Noah. Some few came down, and a small
glass of brandy was handed to them to drink Gamle
Norge. It was after all very convenient not to be able
to answer all the questions asked; much trouble was
saved. We had provisions, and it was not of much consequence
to us, in the way we had chosen to travel, if we
did not understand many words, and could not satisfy all
curiosity. The trout from the Mjösen, it is said, cannot
ascend the falls of the Honnefos; they are exceedingly
good, and some are stated to have weighed 36 lbs.
Gipsies being a restless people, Noah and Zachariah were
sent to fish with two rods and some small trout flies; we
had no hope of their catching anything, but it employed
their time, and was an occupation for them. The water
was a light snowy blue, with a strong and rapid stream.
Esmeralda felt sleepy, and was threatened with the loss
of a pair of gloves; yet we felt that we could not play
with her, or approach her on any other terms than were
honourable to both. We worked at our notes and maps
while the gipsy maiden slept, and her brothers slashed
the water in the rapids below; about seven o’clock
Noah and Zachariah returned, as I expected, without
any matchee (fish).<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> A number of people came down the
embankment occasionally to look with curious interest on
the donkeys. The animals were carefully examined, and
another page was added to the natural history of
Aronsveen. One interesting young person came and
looked from the road above at Noah with much interest;
she afterwards came a second time, and lingered ere she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
left. We decided that, as we had started so early, we
should rest where we were for the night, and start early
the next morning, about four o’clock.</p>

<p>Noah, after a coaching in Norwegian words, went to
seek bread-and-butter (smör og bröd) at the farm-house.
He was to display some money in his open hand as an
additional inducement. No result being reported on his
return, we sent him a second time to the charge for
fladbröd, but they had not got any to part with. We
lighted our fire; tea was made, and a pleasant meal of
fried bacon, college biscuits and butter, was soon concluded.
Bread was bought, when we had the chance, in
order to save our biscuits.</p>

<p>It was now decided to have our tents pitched for the
night. Noah had just made the holes with the kettle-prop,
and was putting in the tent rods, when a number
of people suddenly appeared at the edge of the embankment
above. Down came a tall gentleman, apparently
between fifty and sixty, followed by probably his son
and a short stout gentleman. He said something in a
tone of authority to Noah, who, not understanding what
was said, went on calmly with his tent-pitching. We
were at a short distance from Noah with Esmeralda,
arranging some of our baggage. It appeared to us that
something about illegal was said: breakers ahead crossed
our mind; we must port helm. We advanced to Noah’s
assistance, and said in Norsk&mdash;“Good evening;” then we
quietly reached out our silver-mounted flask, and pouring
out a small glass of brandy, handed it to the senior of
the party. He handed it back politely for us to drink
first. We just tasted it, and said, Gamle Norge.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
took a small sip and then emptied the glass. We poured
out another and handed it to the younger visitor, whom
we took to be the son, a well-dressed, nice-looking,
gentlemanly young fellow, who drank some of it. His
father seemed one whose views of the world were stern
and not on the lively side of the picture. His son had
a pleasant twinkle in the eye, and seemed rather amused
at the scene. The father then began apparently asking
questions. We did not understand much of what he
said, and Noah and Zachariah continued putting in the
tent-rods, without troubling themselves about the matter.
It was necessary to say something, and we informed
them we were going at four o’clock next morning, pointing
to our watch; and thinking it best to clench the affair, we
quietly opened our courier-bag, and handed the document
kindly given us by the Presten Eilert Sundt. We felt
much in the position of the Harlequin and Columbine,
who are suddenly brought to a dead lock in a Christmas
representation, and have to invoke for their safety some
good genius of extraordinary power. We quickly observed
the countenance of the senior gentleman who
commenced reading. “Herr Hubert Smith from England,
with Tater (Rommanes gipsies), three donkeys, and two
tents, &amp;c., travelling from Christiania to Romsdal,
Voringfos, &amp;c., to Christiansand, to see the country and
study the Norwegian gipsies, etc.; with a final request
that we should have help and assistance from his
countrymen,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> When our visitors came to the signature,
“Eilert Sundt!!!” said the senior gentleman in a
deep whisper to his son; the son, who was also looking
over the paper, seemed equally astonished. They examined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the seal for a few moments, and handed the
document back. Without saying more, they watched
the tents which were put up soon after. They seemed
rather surprised at our tent with all its paraphernalia
and fittings, and then politely lifting their hats and bowing,
without another word they suddenly left the scene.
The people who were collected on the top of the embankment
as spectators evidently did not seem to understand
how it was. Perhaps some terrific example was expected
to be made of our tall gipsy, Noah, as a warning to all
the gipsies in Norway. It is impossible to say, and probably
it will remain one of the links in the history of our
wanderings which can never be supplied, nor is it of
much consequence.

<p>Our tents were pitched with a balk towards the
embankment, made with our blue rug embellished with
foxes’ heads. The rug was stretched along our Alpine
stocks driven in the ground. At the top of the embankment,
some of the people still remained watching. Our
large <i>siphonia</i> waterproof was stretched, and fastened
over the intervening space between the tents. Only an
opening was left close to the edge of the steep and
almost perpendicular declivity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>The sound of the river was music to us, as it foamed
in the stillness of the night. We retired within the
parascenium or partition of our tent, and were soon
asleep. Soundly we slept, lulled by the roar of the
falls of the Honnefos; we did not even hear the noise
of a small stone afterwards thrown against the tent from
above, or the rush of Noah and Zachariah outside with
nothing on but their shirts, nor their shouts to the
people above, who only laughed, and had no doubt done
it merely to take a last fond look of our tall gipsy, Noah.
They must have been profoundly impressed by their
very picturesque attire.</p>

<p>We awoke at 12.20; it was rather too early for our
start, so we turned, missed the time, and awoke at half-past
five instead of four o’clock. The word was given.
All were soon stirring. It had rained heavily in the
night. Tents were struck, donkeys packed; at a quarter
past seven o’clock we were <i>en route</i>. Esmeralda was
as lively as possible. We were all in excellent spirits,
our donkeys stepping out bravely with their loads. Our
beautiful Puru Rawnee leads the way, the hawk bells
jingling on its light collar of scarlet bocking. At every
place we passed, we had a rush of the country peasants
to see us. It was amusing to observe their eagerness
to be in time, as they left their occupations in hot haste
to gaze upon our donkeys. At some places we had been
expected. Some mysterious intimation had been given,
and the peasants were ready drawn up waiting with
great expectations our approach. As we journeyed
onwards, it was desirable to buy bread to save our stock
of biscuits. Noah tried at one or two houses. The
first was a large house where they were evidently waiting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
our arrival. The windows were embellished by many
heads: the female sex predominated; most of the males
appeared in a courtyard opening to the road. “Try
here,” we said to Noah, giving him some money to
take in his hand, “and say, ‘smör og bröd.’” He was
not successful, for he was shown into a large room, with
coffee, bread, &amp;c., on the table. Probably he could not
make any one understand, or they had no bread to sell,
for he returned empty-handed. One man we noticed
soon afterwards running in the distance across the fields.
It was amusing to see the wild struggles he made to
be in time. With much sympathy for his unwonted
efforts to accomplish so much speed, we had regulated
the pace of our donkeys to give him a chance.</p>

<p>At last we came to a quiet part of the road between
two fir woods, with a narrow space of green sward on
each side; a rippling stream crossed the road in its
course to the River Logan. The sun gleamed pleasantly
forth. Our fire was soon lighted, and our meal consisted
of biscuit, Australian preserved meat, and tea. The
Australian meat was much appreciated as an edible:
we were all agreeably surprised to find it so good. In
a country like Norway, it is indispensable to those who
seek the freedom of camp-life. As we concluded our
meal down came the rain, but we were prepared, and all
our things were immediately under our large waterproof.
Then we sheltered ourselves with the waterproof rugs,
and quietly waited for the heavy shower to cease. Several
carrioles were driven by, and some carts passed. Noah
had to lead one pony who shied at our donkeys; another
pony had to be taken out and coaxed by them. The
Norwegian ponies, who are the most docile animals in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the world, were often suspicious of our harmless donkeys,
who, quietly browsing, looked as unlike dangerous
ferocity as could possibly be imagined. The rain ceased.
It was eleven. Esmeralda and ourselves pushed on
along the road with two donkeys already loaded, whilst
Noah and Zachariah were putting the remaining baggage
on the third. When they came in sight shortly afterwards,
Esmeralda said we must pretend to be strange
gipsies, and ask them where they were <i>gelling</i> to.</p>

<p>“Shawshon baugh?” (how do you do), said Esmeralda,
drawing herself up with an assumed look of contempt, as
her brothers came up with their donkey and baggage.</p>

<p>“Shawshon baugh?” said they; “where be you a
<i>gelling</i> (going) to? I suppose you Romany’s have been
married some time.”</p>

<p>“Howah,” (yes) said Esmeralda, “we’ve been married
about a year.”</p>

<p>We must confess to a queer sensation that by some
gipsy incantation we were no longer free.</p>

<p>“Which is your merle?” (gip., donkey), demanded
Noah, stalking up to the front.</p>

<p>“That’s mandys” (mine), said Esmeralda, pointing to
the Puru Rawnee, which she claimed for her own.
Gipsy wives have evidently separate rights of property,
thought we, which we were not before aware of. “The
other is my husband’s,” said Esmeralda, looking at us
with her dark eyes, which made us feel as if we were
merged into another individuality.</p>

<p>“Will you gipsies chaffer with us?” said Noah and
Zachariah.</p>

<p>But we remarked, “Your merle’s got no tail.” This
was said in disparagement of the one supposed to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
theirs, for our donkeys were by no means wanting in
this respect. The tail of one was perhaps rather smaller
than the other’s.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Esmeralda, “that’s your donkey. You
don’t know one merle from another.”</p>

<p>They had got mixed, and we had mistaken the one
just come up. The serious earnestness of the gipsy girl
gave us a hearty laugh. So they went on rockering
(talking) in their Romany mous (gipsy language). As we
journeyed onwards, how fragrant the wild flowers. Those
wild flowers of Norway can never be forgotten. Gipsies
like flowers, it is part of their nature. Esmeralda would
pluck them, and, forming a charming bouquet interspersed
with beautiful wild roses, her first thought was
to pin them in the button-hole of the Romany Rye
(gipsy gentleman). We were not the only party with
tents and baggage; for we had noticed, as we passed
along the road from Lillehammer, a number of white
military tents pitched in the valley below us, on a
pleasant flat of turf land on the opposite side the River
Logan. We were informed afterwards, it was an encampment
of the Norwegian militia for military training.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we passed a large house near the
roadside, which appeared to be a gjœstgiver gaard.
The people came out to look at us. Noticing some
articles for sale in the window, we sent Noah back with
some money, and he soon after returned with ten loaves
of bread, and a pound and a half of butter, for which he
paid four marks and a half. Noah said he bought all
the bread they had. We were so well pleased with the
acquisition, that, finding it was a general shop, Zachariah
was sent back to replace his dilapidated hat with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
new wide-a-wake, which cost us one dollar. When
we examined the hat on his return, we read within it
the well-known English name of Christy. Noah and
Zachariah had each invested in a handkerchief; Noah’s
consisted of four pictures of the loudest pattern. Noah’s
commercial transactions had also extended to a pipe
and tobacco, and he appeared smoking it to the disgust
of the rest of the party. Indications of coming rain
caused us to arrange the waterproofs over our baggage.
Several people came up to look at our donkeys.</p>

<p>The bread being packed safely away, we again pushed
on, and entered a wild, thick forest at the foot of some
steep rocky hills. The River Logan was not far to our
left. Taking the first opportunity, we now told Noah
that it was contrary to the rules of our camp to smoke,
and that he must at once give up his pipe and tobacco.</p>

<p>“No, no, sir,” said Noah, in a melancholy tone, “I
must have some tobacco.”</p>

<p>“Well, Noah,” we replied, “we must have our wish,
we have always done what we could for you, and we
expect some sacrifice in return.”</p>

<p>Esmeralda and Zachariah joined in the request.</p>

<p>A slight cloud passed over Noah’s look as he dropped
behind. We must, however, do him the justice to say
that his temper was excellent. Noah was ever cheerful
under the greatest difficulties.</p>

<p>As we quietly journeyed through the forest, how delightful
its scenes. Free from all care, we enjoy the
anticipation of a long and pleasant ramble in Norway’s
happy land. We felt contented with all things, and
thankful that we should be so permitted to roam, with
our tents and wild children of nature in keeping with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the solitudes we sought. So we travelled onwards towards
Holmen. The rain had soon ceased. Tinkle,
tinkle went the hawk-bells on the collar of our Puru
Rawnee, as she led the way along the romantic
Norwegian road.</p>

<p><span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Give the snakes and toads a twist,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And banish them for ever,”<br /></span>
</span></span>

sang Zachariah, ever and anon giving similar wild
snatches. Then Esmeralda would rocker about being the
wife of the Romany Rye, and as she proudly paced along
in her heavy boots, she pictured, in painful imagery, the
pleasant life we should lead as her Romany mouche. She
was full of fun: yet there was nothing in her fanciful delineations
which could offend us. They were but the foam
of the crested wave, soon dissipated in air. They were the
evanescent creations of a lively, open-hearted girl. Wild
notes trilled by the bird of the forest. We came again
into the open valley. Down a meadow gushed a small
streamlet, which splashed from a wooden spout on to the
road-side below. From a log cottage in the meadow
above, a man quickly crawled down the steep bank, like
a spider along in his web. He took his station on the
bank near the streamlet’s falling water. The man was
pale and wan, and begged for alms. He seemed to have
no use in his legs. Could we refuse? We who roamed
free as the birds of the air. We gave him some skillings.
The man seemed very thankful, and we soon after saw
him crawling slowly up to his small wooden cottage,
from whence he commanded a view of the road. Now
we came near the river-side, and pushed along to find a
camping ground. We had again forest on either side.
The river was near, and on the hills of the narrow valley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
we could see many farms. At last we decided to camp
on a rise of ground above the road: an open woodland,
on the edge of the thick forest, which covered the hill
above. The road wall was broken down in one place,
giving passage for the donkeys, after we had unloaded
them. Our things were hoisted up, and soon carried to
a pleasant slope, partly secluded with scattered brushwood
and trees, having a view of the road, river, and
lofty hills on the opposite side of the valley. The rain
commenced as we were pitching our tents. The first
losses we discovered were our two caps and guard, with
a carved fish at the end of it, and the green veil in which
they were wrapped. It was provoking. They must have
been left on the roadside when we halted near the house
where we bought the ten loaves of bread; probably near
Gillebo or Skardsmoen. They were of black felt, and
we were now left with only the straw hat we then wore.</p>

<p>Our tents had not been long pitched, and our fire made,
when a tall, pale man came to us from the road. He
carried a wallet; had a walking-stick in his hand, and we
understood him to say he was going to Romsdalen. He
seemed much interested with our tents, and accepted
some brandy and tobacco. The spot where our tents
were pitched was near a sort of small natural terrace, at
the summit of a steep slope above the road, backed by a
mossy bank, shaded by brushwood, and skirting the dense
foliage of the dark forest of pine and fir rising above our
camp. We had tea and bread, and our Australian meat,
which was excellent. The clouds gathered darkly over
the mountains, and there were some heavy showers.
More visitors came in succession; some had brandy.
Their attention seemed divided between the tents and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
donkeys. At length the rain probably prevented more
from coming.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, when we got into camp,
Noah came and said, “I think, sir, instead of buying
tobacco, I had much better have put the money by to
get me a pair of stockings.” We asked how much he
gave, and he said half a mark. “Then, Noah, give up
the pipe and tobacco, and you shall have the half-mark.”
Our gipsy came soon after. He had evidently made up
his mind.</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, you don’t like my smoking, sir; here’s
the tobacco and pipe. I don’t wish you to say I didn’t
do what you required.”</p>

<p>As Noah handed over the pipe and tobacco, one would
have thought he had given up some dearly-prized treasure.
Although we gave him the half-mark with pleasure,
we could not help feeling some compunction; still, as
“shorengro” (gipsy chief) of the party, we were bound
to see the camp rules obeyed, and Noah knew them
before he started. Pusillanimity and want of firmness
would have destroyed the success of the expedition.</p>

<p>After tea we sat up to write our notes. The occurrences
and events of each day must be written whilst
they are fresh in the memory. Nor must they be left to
remembrance, or the clear lettering of correctness and
truth will be lost. What are now given are mere transcripts
of notes written on the spot, and at the time.
Whatever be their worth, rough as they are, it is hoped
their truth will give them some value. We were glad
to retire to rest. It rained heavily in the night. Once
or twice the light Siphonia waterproof was blown off.
Noah had to get up in the night to put it on, and to dig
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
a trench round the tents. We could feel the moisture
coming in from the bank above. It was with difficulty
we kept our provisions dry.</p>

<p>Our first Sunday morning in camp. It was one of our
camp rules never to travel on a Sunday. It was made a
day of rest for ourselves and the animals. We looked
forward throughout our travels to our Sunday for quietude
and repose. The morning was dull and wet. We breakfasted
about seven o’clock. The frokost (Nor., breakfast)
consisted of fried bacon, bread, and tea. The materials
for a soup for dinner were put ready. Whilst it was
cooking, a German gentleman, accompanied by his
skydskarl, came up from the road. He inquired if we
were German. Then he informed us that there was an
account of us in the newspapers. Having looked at our
tents, we sent Zachariah with him to see the donkeys.
The German gentleman seemed much gratified, and,
shaking hands with Zachariah, left our camp. Many
carriages passed along the road during the day. After
our dinner of soup, made of ham, peas, flour, and Liebig’s
essence of meat, we remained in our tents. Some young
peasant men and women came and sat in the rain outside
looking at us. We gave two of the peasants some brandy
and tobacco. Then all our visitors left, except four
interesting young peasant girls, who still lingered. One
had an umbrella, and all four standing in the rain at a
short distance from our camp, sang for us a Norwegian
song to a pretty Norwegian air. They had pleasant
voices. We listened to them with much pleasure. There
was so much sweetness and feeling in the melody. It
was a serenade of four Norwegian peasant girls. We
appreciated their kind attention to wanderers from a far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
land. Though we could not converse, we thanked them
with our looks when they afterwards left the camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_112" src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PEASANT GIRLS’ SERENADE.</p></div>

<p>We had many visitors. At one time a group of five
young peasant girls came and stood before our tents.
Noah was too shy to go out and rocker Norwegian.
Zachariah made up for his brother’s timidity. Full of fun,
what dreadful faces the young gipsy would pull. They
were absolutely frightful. Then he would twist and turn
his body into all sorts of serpentine contortions. If spoken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
to, he would suddenly, with a hop, skip, and a jump, light
in his tent, as if he had tumbled from the sky, and sitting
bolt upright, making a hideous face, till his mouth nearly
stretched from ear to ear, while his dark eyes sparkled
with wild excitement, he would sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dawdy! Dawdy! dit a kei,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rockerony fake your bosh.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At one time a woman brought an exceedingly fat child
for us to look at, and she wanted Esmeralda to suckle it,
which was of course hastily declined. We began to ask
ourselves, if this was forest seclusion. Still, our visitors
were kind, good-humoured people, and some drank our
brandy, and some smoked our English tobacco. Had
they not partaken of our salt? We, as Arabs of tent-life,
gave them our friendly welcome. After our tea, at five
o’clock we had a pleasant stroll. Once more we were
with Nature. There we lingered, till the scenes round
us, in their varied beauty, seemed graven deep in our
thoughts. How graphic are the lines of Moore:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The turf shall be my fragrant shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My temple, Lord! that arch of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My censer’s breath the mountain airs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And silent thoughts my only prayers.<br /></span>
</span><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My choir shall be the moonlight waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">then murm’ring homeward to their caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or when the stillness of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even more of music breathes of thee.”<br /></span>
</span></span>

How appropriate, were the words of the great poet to
our feelings. Returning between eight and nine o’clock,
we found Esmeralda standing by the tents. We went in
and sat down. Another party of visitors approached.
Now and then they halted, as they looked towards our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
tents, and would then refer to a paper. They stood
occasionally for a few moments in earnest discussion.
We were much puzzled to make out what they were
doing, as we sat in our tent looking at them. One of the
party, a tall, fine-looking man in plaid trousers, large
beard, and cap, advanced. As we bowed, he handed us
a Norwegian newspaper, and pointed to a paragraph,
which we soon found related to ourselves. They all took
some brandy; and when we offered to buy the newspaper,
they most kindly presented it to us. Then
Zacharia took them to see the donkeys. When they
returned, we made them understand, that they were at
the camp of the Englishman, referred to in the paragraph.
They inspected the tents and pinthorns. They felt the
blanket coverings, and also the waterproof Siphonian
cover. Examined our camp kettle; and we explained
to them the mysteries of our Russian lamp. There
was much discussion among them about our tents.
They stood by them for a quarter of an hour. Perhaps
the description in the paragraph was not quite understood.
The paragraph ran thus, and underneath we give
an English translation:&mdash;</p>

<h3>TRANSLATION OF THE FOREGOING.</h3>

<h4>“AN ORIGINAL ENGLISHMAN.</h4>

<p>“Among the numerous foreign tourists, says the
Morgen bladett (Morning Paper), there is at present staying
at Byen, with an intention of proceeding inland, an
English gentleman, Mr. Smith, who has made a new invention
for the use of tourists. He neither travels by
carriage or boat, but on foot, and nevertheless carries
with him food, drink, clothes, shoes, and every other
necessary of life in a small compass. It consists of a
folding contrivance on three donkeys, in which the articles
are packed, and is carried on the back, forming when
spread out a tent, whenever he wishes to halt, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
tent can be struck at pleasure. The invention is of a
completely nomadic character, and to render the expedition
still more consistent, he is accompanied during the
journey, by a party of real nomads, viz.:&mdash;three Tartars
(gipsies), two brothers, and a sister as servants. Mr.
Smith designs to spend three or four months in our upper
plateaux, in which he is far more reasonable than many
of our tourists, few of whom do more than join some
small party in the ordinary way.”</p>

<p>Our friend in the plaid trousers, who seemed a shrewd,
intelligent man, did his best to solve all difficulties. We
could not feel otherwise than pleased at the interest they
took in our expedition. The voice of the tall man in
plaid trousers generally dominated the conversation. At
length, after a comparison between the respective merits of
donkeys and mules, with many salutations, they left our
camp. They had scarcely gone, when two or three good-looking
peasant girls came, accompanied by some young
men, and one rather good-looking woman, who asked a
variety of questions in rapid succession. It is to be feared
our answers were exceedingly indefinite, but she seemed to
explain everything to everybody, and we began to look
upon her as part and parcel of our camp. One lively,
good-tempered, nice-looking girl knelt down near us, as
we were seated writing our notes, and kept looking at
everything in the tents, not hidden from view. Sometimes
she laughed so merrily, that the impulse was catching,
and we found ourselves joining, in her cheerful mood.
Esmeralda had retired to sleep; the visitors were very
anxious to see her, when informed by signs she was
asleep, they contented themselves with looking at her
Alpine slippers, which came in for a long criticism by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
rather good-looking visitor, who explained everything, to
everybody, until the hour becoming late they all left.</p>

<p>It rained heavily during the night, and it required some
management to keep our things dry.</p>

<p>At 12.38 <small>A.M.</small> we called to Noah to report upon the
morning,&mdash;“All misty and wet,” said Noah, as he looked
out; and our getting up was postponed till six o’clock,
when all rose for frokost (breakfast). Zachariah made the
“yog” (gip., fire) in the wet damp morning; then when
the fire burnt up, Zachariah, in putting our kettle of soup
on the kettle-prop to be ready for breakfast, contrived to
upset nearly the whole. The scene was melancholy and
effective; the reverse of complimentary, were the observations
of the rest of the party. Accidents will happen,
so making the best of our loss, tea was substituted.
Zachariah seemed more than any of the rest, disappointed
and grieved, at what had occurred.

<p>When frokost (Nor., breakfast) was over, we sent Noah
and Zachariah to the Logan, with a fishing-rod each, and
some trout-flies. Esmeralda stayed at the tents, and added
to the remains of the former stock of soup, some rice,
Liebig’s essence of meat, pea flour, and some mushrooms,
gathered <i>en route</i>. She prepared some excellent soup
for middags-mad (Nor., dinner). Esmeralda was standing
outside the tents, when a traveller from Throndhjem came
up with his Skydskarl from the road; he spoke to her in
English, but she did not appear to understand him.
When we came out of the tents, the stranger bowed, and
said it was a pleasant way of travelling. He asked if
we were Italians, at the same time looking at Esmeralda.
We informed him the others were Romanys. He wished
to know if we had our wife with us, and we informed him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
we were not married. Then our visitor asked how we
managed in the rain, and when he had looked round our
camp, politely took off his hat, and left. Noah and
Zachariah returned without having had a rise. Leaving
them in charge of the camp, Esmeralda and myself went
to see a waterfall, but, missing our way in the forest, we
returned laden with ferns, foxgloves, and lichens. We
found at our camp a very respectably dressed young
woman, accompanied by a girl with scanty white petticoat,
barelegs and feet. Getting out our dictionary, we told
them they should have some music, if they came at seven
that evening. They mentioned otta klokken (Nor., eight
o’clock), and it was so arranged. Noah and Zachariah
having played them two or three tunes, our visitors left.
The soup at dinner was excellent, and with some bread
and butter, made a good meal. The weather now became
very fine; we seated ourselves on a mossy bank, some
short distance at the edge of the tangled thickets of the
forest, which skirted our camp. Gleams of sunshine
enlivened the scene. Esmeralda was busily cleaning our
boots, when we noticed close to us, a tall, gentlemanly,
Norwegian officer. He wore a military cap, and had
come along a narrow pathway through the trees. We
had not heard his footsteps, and as he paused for a moment,
a faint smile seemed to play on his countenance. We
bowed, and asked him if he spoke English, but finding
he was not able to do so, we sent Noah to show him
the donkeys. Noah was busily levelling, with our camp
spade, certain inequalities of the small terrace near our
camp, so that our visitors might have level turf for their
dancing in the evening. When the officer returned,
he appeared to wish to say something in English; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
dictionary was handed to him, but that failing, Mr.
Bennett’s “Dialogue Book” was given as a <i>dernier
ressort</i>. Whilst he was in search of words, Esmeralda
was busy brushing our clothes; sometimes he was
turning over the pages, and sometimes he seemed rather
astonished and amused at Esmeralda’s style of brushing,
especially when she pulled our coat, and gave us a
bang with the brush for not turning round. In vain
he searched the “Dialogue Book,” and then he shook
his head. Esmeralda completed her task, and declared
we looked five pounds better. We then showed the
officer the tents.</p>

<p>It was with much regret, we felt our inability to
converse, yet it is astonishing what can be done, by a few
words and signs. His carriage was in the road below.
The day had become pleasant and warm; Zachariah and
Esmeralda seated themselves on the mossy bank by the
terrace, not far from our tents. Soon their wild music
might be heard in the forest. The driver and a boy
belonging to the officer’s carriage came up. A militia
soldier marching along the road in a light suit of jean,
with his knapsack on his back, was called up by his
officer, whom he saluted. Our audience was complete.
The officer was going to the militia encampment we had
noticed as we came from Lillehammer. The music
seemed to please him; he laughed at Zachariah’s wild
comicality. When they had finished, with an exchange
of salutations, he wished us good-by, and left. Our
visitors were now gone. Noah and Zachariah washed
themselves; and we had our tea, with potted tongue, and
bread and cheese. As we were seated by our camp-fire,
a tall old man, looking round our tents, came and stood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
contemplating us at our tea. He looked as if he thought
we were enjoying a life of happiness. Nor was he
wrong. He viewed us with a pleased, and kindly expression,
as he seemed half lost in contemplation. We
sent for the flask of brandy, and he drank to Gamle
Norge (Nor., Old Norway), and then left to see the
donkeys. In a few minutes Esmeralda cleaned and re-packed
our tea things.</p>

<p>Returning to our tent we put on our Napoleon boots,
and made some additions to our toilette; whilst we were
so engaged, some women came to the tents. The
curiosity of the sex was exemplified, for they were
dying to look behind the tent-partition which screened us
from observation. We don’t know what they expected
to see; one bolder than the rest, could not resist the
desire, to look behind the scenes, and hastily drew back
and dropped the curtain, when we said rather sharply,
“Nei! nei!”</p>

<p>Esmeralda shortly afterwards appeared in her blue
dress and silver buttons. Then we all seated ourselves
on a mossy bank, on the side of the terrace, with a
charming view across the valley of the Logan. At
eight o’clock the music commenced. The sun shone
beautifully, and the mosquitoes and midges bit right and
left, with hungry determination. We sat in line on the
soft mossy turf of the grassy slope, sheltered by foliage,
Esmeralda and Noah with their tambourines, myself with
the castanets, and Zachariah with his violin. We had not
played very long, when a man passing along the road
below heard the music, and ran up. Much astonished he
seemed, as he stood at a short distance from us, on the
side of the terrace, and gazed at each by turn. When a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
tune ended he smiled approvingly. Some peasant
women and girls came up after we had played a short
time. It was a curious scene. Our tents were pleasantly
pitched on an open patch of green sward, surrounded
by bordering thickets, near the sunny bank, and
the small flat terrace, which Noah had levelled in the
morning. The main road was immediately below; and
down the valley rolled the wide river Logan, with a picturesque
island, dividing its rapid stream. The rising
hills and rugged ravines on the other side the valley, all
gave a singular, and romantic beauty to the lovely view.
Although our gipsies played with much spirit until nine
o’clock, none of the peasants would dance. At nine
o’clock our music ceased, and we all retired to our
tents, with the intention of going to bed. When we were
going into our tents, a peasant, and several others with
him, who had just arrived, asked us to play again. We
declined, for we had already played an hour, and merely
did so for our own will and pleasure. The peasants
appeared very anxious, and offered us a three or four
skilling piece, which we politely refused. At length,
observing several peasant girls were very much disappointed,
we decided to play once more, It was past
nine o’clock when we again took up our position on the
mossy bank. Noah was accepted by one of the Norwegian
girls as a partner, and we made another couple
with a good-looking young peasant “pige” (Nor., girl).
When she was tired, we danced with Esmeralda. Both
partners managed the schottische famously on the level
turf. So we danced, and the peasant girls, until
nearly ten o’clock. The terrace was rather limited in
extent. Once we nearly whirled ourself and Esmeralda
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
over the slope, and into the road below. The gipsies
suffered grievously from musketos early in the evening.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said we to the gipsies, “that is soon prevented.”</p>

<p>Producing a bottle of tincture of cedar, which a
Canadian friend had heard was an infallible remedy, all
our gipsies’ faces, including our own, were carefully
painted over with the brown liquid. For the information
of our readers, we can only say it was a decided failure,
and after several trials, in which the tincture only seemed
to irritate the skin, without deterring in the slightest
degree, the rapacity of hundreds of devouring insects,
tincture of cedar was voted a miserable delusion, and a
provoking sham.</p>

<p>Soon after we had wished our visitors “god aften,”
(Nor., good evening) and had retired to our tents, a
carriage pulled up in the road below. The occupants
came up and walked round our camp. We did not see
them, but were told afterwards by our gipsies, that one
of our visitors, was the young man who had assisted us
with our provision case at Lillehammer.</p>

<p>At half-past two o’clock the next morning, Tuesday,
the twenty-eighth of June, all were moving. The idea
that we were first up was speedily proved incorrect.
Directly we left our tents, a Norwegian tramp, of torn
and tattered appearance, came and gazed at our camp in
mute astonishment, and then silently departed.</p>

<p>Esmeralda was soon up. Our kettle of soup was put
ready to boil for breakfast, and the fire was lighted.
Noah took charge of the kettle and pepper. The soup
was boiled, and served out in our bowls, as we sat in the
rather dull, cloudy, cold morning round the fire. Never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
shall we forget Zachariah’s look of epicurean disappointment,
and misery, as he tasted the soup, and threw down
his spoon.</p>

<p>“Now then, Noah, I can’t eat it!” We could not
help laughing. Then it was tasted by ourselves.
Esmeralda tasted it. Noah had literally deluged it with
pepper. The soup was condemned. Noah took our
anything but complimentary remarks upon his cuisine,
with his usual good-temper, and, as if to show that the
soup was really not so bad, he finished our shares as well
as his own. Slices of bread and butter were cut for
ourself, Esmeralda, and Zachariah, and we decided that
Noah should never again attempt any culinary operations.</p>

<p>Hastily striking camp, all our things were packed and
loaded. Our party left the camp ground at half-past
five o’clock.</p>

<p>On the right of the road, going to Holmen, a short
distance below our camp, we passed the mile-stone which
marked two and a half Norsk miles, or seventeen and a
half English miles from Lillehammer.</p>

<p>At Holmen bread could not be purchased, but we were
told that we could get some at a house beyond, where
Esmeralda afterwards bought eight loaves for two marks
and a half. Several men followed us along the road to see
our donkeys.</p>

<p>Passing a small sheet of water, some crows on the
the bank were so tame that they allowed us to come
close to them. The Norwegian crow has some white
about it, but in size it is much the same as the English
crow.</p>

<p>As we reached the shores of the Losna Vand, a long
narrow lake, the rain clouds seemed to be gathering over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
some very picturesque mountains near its shores.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Coming
to a small recess of ground, by a stream of water on the road
side near the lake, a halt was called&mdash;in truth we were
rather hungry. The remembrance of the hot soup had
not become effaced from Zachariah’s memory. When
our things were unpacked, it was at once discovered, that
our kettle prop had been left at our last camp. We were
much annoyed, not only on account of the difficulty of
boiling our things, but with regard to making holes in the
ground for our tent raniers. As a substitute for our lost
kettle prop, two Alpine stocks were brought into use, and
some twisted wire was fastened between them, to suspend
our kettle over the fire. Whilst we were engaged in
preparing our meal, the rain storm gathered on the hills
at the head of the lake. All our baggage was safely
stowed away under our invaluable siphonia tent cover.
Esmeralda was also sheltered in a comfortable place
amongst the baggage. As her brothers and ourselves
were pouring out the tea, it began to rain heavily. Soon
afterwards, we found the donkeys had strayed out of
sight, and Noah had to follow them at least half a mile,
before he could bring them back to the camp.</p>

<p>A woman soon made her appearance and begged.
We think she lived in a house on the road side, not very
far from where we were. Four skillings seemed to please
her very much. Then came a little boy dressed in only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
a few rags, who seated himself near our camp as we were
taking our breakfast. The rain had almost ceased for a
short time. The boy looked so piteous, as we were
demolishing, with considerable appetite, tea, bread and
butter, and sardines, that we could not help giving him
some bread and butter. The little fellow said nothing,
but putting out his hand, he clasped ours with a look of
intense gratitude. Then came three small girls, and
they also had bread and butter. The rain recommenced,
but, breakfast being finished, Esmeralda was carefully
covered up. Noah and Zachariah immediately disappeared
underneath some part of the waterproof and fell asleep.
We retired also, with our head just out, so that we could
observe the travellers passing along the road. Several
peasants came up, and stared at the donkeys, as they stood
in the rain, near our dark mass of siphonian waterproof,
with nothing else to be seen, but our head. They asked
a number of questions with very little result, after which
the donkies were again examined. Their mouths were
opened, teeth reckoned, and their conformation carefully
noted. Their tails were handled. Sometimes one of the
donkeys, on such occasions, would move his hind leg, and
great was the rush to get out of his way. We were
asked their ages. The visit generally wound up with an
earnest discussion amongst themselves, in which we could
distinguish the words asen (donkeys), and heste (horses),
often repeated.</p>

<p>Another group of women and men soon came to the
spot, and, as we rested on our elbows with our head, out
of our waterproof, we were again the subject of farther
interrogatory. It is probable they did not elicit
much, though our vocabulary improved with the journey.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
A peasant drove up with a crippled militia man. The
driver at once got down in haste. He was particularly
curious about the donkeys; in fact the three donkeys were
evidently expected to be seen somewhere on the route,
and they had become the subject of eager anxiety.</p>

<p>At one time, we almost expected to see the lone figure
of the Birmingham bagman, in the driving rain, on the
lake side, hovering near our donkeys, but he never came.
Rain, rain, ever rain. We tried to write our notes, but
our pencil formed all kinds of arabesque lines in zigzag
pattern, which still remain in our note-book, and we fell
asleep. The falling book awoke us to consciousness, and
the necessity for action. We gave Esmeralda some
quinine and water, and took some ourselves. Taking
advantage of a lull in the rain-storm, the order was given
to pack up, and we were soon <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The Losna Vand is a picturesque lake, but its beauty
would have been more appreciated on a fine day. Our
party travelled on, till we crossed a bridge over a stream,
at the foot of a wild gorge. At the house near, we obtained
two loaves of rye bröd, and half a pound of butter for 9<i>d.</i>
The rain poured down heavily. We took shelter from
the driving rain and wind, for a short time, to the leeward
of a small log hut, on the shore of the lake by the roadside,
whilst the donkeys stood under the wall on the other
side the road. The gipsies were as lively as usual,
though they were wet through, and had no change. We
had our light siphonia waterproof on, and Esmeralda her
long Alpine cloak. The gipsies sang, whilst Zachariah
tumbled, and danced, and laughed, and pulled all kinds of
dreadful faces. Then Noah found a curious round stone
of quartz, but it was too heavy to carry. Some women
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
came and looked at us with curious interest. We did
not stay long. Notwithstanding the wind and rain, we
must continue our journey, till we come to some spot
where we can camp. When we had passed a short
distance along the road, an interesting child, who had
come down from a log cottage above, offered us a skilling.
The little girl and her parents had evidently commiserated
our forlorn condition as nomad wanderers, and
were anxious to give their unsolicited assistance. It will
not be forgotten in their account with the next world.
We were obliged to refuse, and, shaking the little girl by
the hand, bade her farewell. May she have long happiness
in life, as her kind heart deserves.

<p>Our donkeys were pressed onwards, and passed some
carts laden with merchandise. Anxiously our gipsies
looked out for a camping ground. The waters of the
lake, dashed in waves on the stony shore. The wind and
rain met us in the teeth. Misty clouds gathered on the
summit of the mountains opposite, as we travelled along
at a quick pace. The packs on our donkeys, were carefully
covered with our waterproofs. In vain we looked
at every point for a camping ground. At one log cottage
on the hill above the road, a woman with a yellow handkerchief
over her head, rushed out, and ran down towards
the road. Then a boy suddenly appeared on the other
side of the house, and throwing up his arms when he saw
us, they revolved like the sails of a windmill, as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
struggled with quickened pace after the woman. Both
ran towards an eminence of ground at some distance
below the house near the road. “I hope they will get
safe down,” remarked we to our gipsies. Sometimes the
boy gained upon the woman. The race was exciting.
Speculations were hazarded as to which would get in
first. The woman might fall, but she did not, and won
the race. Both stood in breathless contemplation as we
passed. At last we reached Vodvang, splashed, wet,
and weary.</p>

<p>There were not many houses at Vodvang. People
were looking out of their windows, and several men had
collected on the balcony of a large house, probably the
gjœstgiver-gaard, to see us as we passed. The church
was a quaint wooden structure painted red. The monumental
records in the graveyard round it, were few in
number&mdash;small wooden crosses, generally of similar pattern.
Two men followed us along the road. Noah was
sent up a wild-looking pathway to the top of a wooded
hill, but found no camping ground. Then we inquired
from the two men, who pointed several times to a thick
fir wood a short distance beyond. We gave them twelve
skillings, which they seemed very reluctant to take, and
wished to return, but we said it was drike penge, and
left them. Proceeding as fast as our donkeys could
travel, for it was now past eight o’clock, we at length
came to a private road, leading, through a gate, to the
wood. There was no time to hesitate. We must go
somewhere. Zachariah swung open the gate, and our
wayworn looking party, were soon in a large, and picturesque
forest glade. The track apparently led to some
house. Almost immediately, we unloaded our baggage,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and commenced pitching our tents, in a small gulley
below the forest track.</p>

<p>The tent rods were scarcely in the ground, when up
came three men, and two boys. The brandy flask was
brought out in the heavy rain, and brandy poured out for
the three men. They seemed pleased that we were going
to camp there, and showed us a better place in the wood,
for the donkeys to graze, than where Zachariah had
tethered them. It was raining fast. Noah and Zachariah
were wet through. Esmeralda not very dry; and our
own boots and legs very wet. Our gipsies were not easily
dispirited. We could not have selected better people for
our campaign; accustomed to all weathers from their
infancy, they met with ourselves cheerfully, all difficulties.
Our tents were soon pitched, the siphonia waterproof
cover fastened, and our things stowed away. Then the
fire must be lighted in the rain. Whilst we prepared the
Russian lamp, Noah gathered sticks. Only damp ones
could be got. A crowd of peasants had come to our
camp, and watched with curious interest our Russian
lamp. They looked on with much astonishment, especially
when the Russian lamp, underneath the sticks, gave
forth its brilliant stream of flame. At the first trial the
lamp ignited the sticks, but the fire was soon extinguished
by the falling rain.</p>

<p>A boy kindly brought us some dry wood, and notwithstanding
the rain, our lamp succeeded upon the second
trial, and our kettle was soon boiling for tea.</p>

<p>Just as we had made the tea, Noah called out in
Romany, that a boro rye (gip., great gentleman) was a
vellin (gip., coming). The new visitor was a young gentleman
wearing spectacles. He said he was not a native
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
of Norway, but from Sweden. He was staying at a large
house on the side of the wood above the road, and had
seen our party come up in the rain from the main route.
Two ladies who were travelling with him were in the
forest track near our tents. Though he did not speak
French, he informed us that one of the ladies was well
acquainted with the language. The ladies then came to
our camp. The rain had partly ceased. One of the
ladies, yet young and good-looking, possessed an ease
and dignity of manner we have seldom met with. She
asked permission, in French, to see our tents. How
useful we always find the French language as a medium
of communication in our wanderings over the world.
The tents were examined. Our gipsies were described
as gitanos, who always dwelt in tents and were faithful
to us. The young lady, her companion, who seemed
amused during the visit, was also much interested in our
wild, wandering life. At length, after a pleasant conversation,
they all three left our camp. Then we had
our tea. The peasants did not come during the meal,
lest they might disturb us. When a number of them
came afterwards, Zachariah played his violin, and Noah
and Esmeralda their tambourines. Great curiosity was
manifested, whilst Zachariah, all life and spirit, sitting in
his damp clothes, on the wet grass by the fire, was ever
pulling queer faces, new and then saying, “Dit a kei,
look at that Bongy mouee, ha, ha”; and again they
played some lively and spirited tune. We lounged in a
corner of our tent. The Swedish gentleman came again.
For some time he sat with Noah by the camp fire, asking
occasional questions in broken English. He was lively
and pleasant, and much fun seemed going on. Noah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
gave him some very original answers. The peasants
seemed anxious to see us all in bed, but at last dispersed,
and we fell asleep.</p>

<p>After a sound and refreshing night’s rest we were up
at 7 o’clock; the morning was fine, and we could now
appreciate the beauties of the woodland scene. The
forest extended over the rocky hills, which bounded the
valley. Esmeralda bustled about to prepare our breakfast;
no one was the worse for the toil and fatigue of
yesterday. Some peasants came, and were told we should
give them some music at Otta Klokken (Nor., 8 o’clock).
Noah and Zachariah were furnished with fishing tackle,
and sent off fishing.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The Swedish gentleman and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
two ladies, we observed early in the morning, passing
along a track through the wood near our camp. We both
saluted. They were making an excursion, partly on foot,
through Norway. As they crossed the river, they met
Zachariah, and asked him if he always slept out in tents,
and how many they were in family. The morning was
devoted by Esmeralda and ourself to our camp arrangements;
she was becoming an excellent housekeeper.
What an impulsive dark-eyed girl! notwithstanding her
odd sayings, and at times roughly turned phrases, one
could not but admire the rude energy, and exercise of
will she possessed. Noah and Zachariah returned.
Mid-day meal consisted of broiled ham, tea, and bread and
cheese. Two men came, and also the woman with bare
legs, who had visited our last camp; they took much
interest in our Australian method of making tea.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Some
children who came had bread and butter; one man had
tobacco, and as they sat near, our musical box seemed to
give them much pleasure. The two men suggested a
better spot in the wood for the donkeys to feed, and they
were taken there. Esmeralda and ourself left at 3
o’clock, and ascending a steep hill through the forest,
reached some broken rocks, where we had a delightful
view. After we had seated ourselves, we wrote our
notes, and Esmeralda, who sat at our side, conversed
occasionally. Who could feel other than regret, at so
much want of culture, and so much wild sterility of mind,
yet if she had undergone the modern methods of training,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
she would no longer have been the wild flower of
nomadic life; she would not have been my companion in
the wild forest, the valley, and lonely glen. There was
much that was impulsive, and original, much that was
impassioned, and sensitive in her powers of appreciation.
It was astonishing, with all her disadvantages, she was
what she was. As the brilliant sunshine of a Norwegian
evening, gilded the pine forests, and distant fjelds, the indescribable
feeling of happy freedom, cast its bright rays
upon our hearts. Lingering for a moment, as we shut
our note book we quitted a scene we may never view
again, and returned through broken forest glades, to our
camp, ready for tea at 6 o’clock. When we reached our
camp, no one was there. Noah came in soon after, having
been in quest of eggs. When our tea, and bread and
butter was consumed, Zachariah returned from a boating
expedition; presently the peasants came, and asked when
the music would begin. Taking out our watch we told
them it was five minutes to 8, and we should begin at 8
o’clock. We sat in our tents, and opened our concert, first
with our gipsy song and guitar accompaniments, and then
with the “Mocking Bird.” The tents were decorated
with a picture of Alpine scenes. One or two tunes were
played by all our gipsy party, but the peasants crowded
round our tents until they nearly brought them down.
Finding they wished to dance, we took some rugs, and
went to the side of the flat roadway through the forest.</p>

<p>The forest scene pleased us; the evening was very
fine. Zachariah never tired as he played his violin;
sometimes we joined with castanets, sometimes with
guitar, and occasionally with tambourine, relieving each
other by turns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>Noah and Esmeralda waltzed together, and the couples
who danced increased. The young men who danced
were not many; the beau of the village, (and we always
had one at all our peasant re-unions) was very active.
We shall never forget, his good-tempered chubby face,
and country bumpkin appearance, as he spun round in
large low shoes, and worsted stockings, voluminous
trowsers, and short jacket, which did not reach below his
waist. The proportions of his Dutch build, were shown
to advantage. It must have been warm work, as he
puffed in his thick cloth snuff-coloured suit. If we looked
through a powerful microscope at the fat boy in “Pickwick”
we should see our friend exactly represented. He
was Wackford Squeers’s sample schoolboy on a large scale.
We can see him now in the open track of the forest at
closing eve, with that stout young peasant girl of the
Rubens style of beauty, twirling in an agony of exertion
as Noah executed a roulade on the tambourine; we liked
to see him, and his dancing was no doubt the envy of
those peasants, who would have done likewise, if they
could.</p>

<p>At half-past 9 our music ceased; several peasants pressed
us to continue; the beau of the village even went so
far as to offer us four skillings&mdash;he was, no doubt, a rich
landed proprietor&mdash;of course we politely refused with
mange tak (Nor., many thanks). Our heart at once relented&mdash;we
have danced ourselves. The beau of the
village, was again in his element, as a whale is at sea.
They had got into step; we had found out the tunes
they liked. At 10 o’clock our music again ceased.
Wishing them good-night, we retired. Several peasants
came to see the tents, one asked for more music, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
finding we did not respond, the last group took off their
hats, and left.</p>

<p>The peasants had not long departed, when down came
Noah in haste to our camp: “The merles (donkeys) are
gone, sir,” said the gipsy. Noah could see how it was.
The ropes were left, and the men who had told us that it
was a better place for grass, had only done so to steal
them. We could not bring ourselves to suspect our
friends, the Norwegian peasants, whom we had just been
entertaining as our visitors, and who were always so kind,
and friendly with us.</p>

<p>We immediately went with Esmeralda in search of our
missing donkeys. Taking a track through the forest,
we met some peasant children, to whom, with some difficulty,
we explained that the donkeys were gone. They
seemed to divine our thoughts, “Nei, nei,” said one little
girl, pointing to a particular part of the wood, and as she
was coming with us, a shout from Noah, and Zachariah,
informed us they were safe. The peasants had kindly
moved them to a better spot for grass. When the
gipsies had tethered one of the donkeys, which they
usually did, they returned to the tents. Noah said some
of the peasants were still gazing at our merles.</p>

<p>The thermometer had been 74° during the day.</p>

<p>Sleep, who could sleep? Myriads of musketos had
invaded our tents. We were all dreadfully bitten.
Sleeping in a rug bag, our face only suffered. Our
forehead was one mass of small swellings. We were all
up at 2 o’clock in the morning. In the tent or out of
the tent it was all the same.</p>

<p>Grievous were the complaints as we ate our breakfast.
Wildly Zachariah flourished his Norwegian knife, as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
enemies of his comfort attacked him on every side. In
vain he vowed vengeance against the “skeatos.” We
were determined not to endure the persecutions of our
numerous tormentors any longer. The morning was
cloudy, with drizzling rain. Striking our tents, we
loaded our donkeys, and a little before 6 o’clock left
the forest, and Losnœs <i>en route</i> for Listad. Near a
beautiful lake, we passed two hamlets, at each of
which our cavalcade occasioned great excitement. New
and varied scenes met us at each turn, as we now left
far behind us the town of Lillehammer, and the
picturesque shores of the Mjösen Vand. It was
astonishing the interest our donkeys occasioned. Here
and there as we passed along, people rushed from their
various pursuits, to get a glimpse of our party. One
woman ran after us, and eagerly asked if the donkeys
eat grass, at the same time plucking some from the road
side, that we might better understand her question. At
one place, we purchased four loaves of bread, and a pound
of butter for 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> Esmeralda at the same time tried
to buy a stardy (gip. for hat) to replace those lost, but
could not get one. At length we reached a large wet
marshy valley, and met some men with long poles tipped
with iron hooks. Soon afterwards a gentleman driving a
carriole overtook us, and asked Noah if we were Italians.
Finding he spoke English, we went up to him, and he
told us he was from Scotland. Telling him we were
travelling <i>à l’aise</i> with our tents and baggage, the
novelty of the idea seemed to delight him, and bowing,
he continued his journey. The end of the marshy
valley, through which the Logan still held its course,
was at length reached. On the side of a large projecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
mass of rock, on the road side, near a stream of water, we
found a large open space of ground, strewn with loose
rocks. Part of the baggage was taken off the donkeys,
who foraged about in rocks for scanty herbage. Lighting
a fire, we had tea, bread, sardines, and Australian
meat. The men with the poles again made their appearance
with increased number. They drew up in line, and
having grounded their poles, stood at ease. First they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
stared at ourselves and gipsies, as we rested near our
baggage, and then at our donkeys. There were nine of
them, of all sizes, and miscellaneous costumes. They
were timber floaters. Their long poles were used to
push the logs of timber adrift, when they stuck fast on
the sides of the river. Quantities of timber cut down in
the forests, and marked, finds transit in this way to the
sea. As we were writing our notes, we also made a
rough sketch of the men. A boy soon afterwards came,
and said something in Norwegian about a quarter of a
mile, which we at last understood to mean a convenient
camping ground at that distance beyond us. Several
other people came, and stood in the road, gazing at
the donkeys, as they wandered about the rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_139" src="images/i_139.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TIMBER-FLOATERS.&mdash;MID-DAY HALT.</p></div>

<p>The sun was now brilliant; the scene was particularly
beautiful. Our gipsies after lunch fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>We had halted about 10 o’clock, and we left at 4
o’clock. Noah was quite unwell, and all suffered, more
or less, from mosquito bites of the previous night. As
we looked back, we could not help pausing some few
minutes, to admire the picturesque outline of the mountains.
We had not been long <i>en route</i> when three Englishmen
in carrioles, came suddenly round a turn in the
road. We heard one exclaim, “Gipsies!” as they overtook
us, and drove by. We noticed the first was a
bronzed, military, good-looking man. The driver of the
second carriole, who was an excellent specimen of the
English gentleman, said something, and bowed, and they
were rapidly followed by a younger gentleman, and soon
out of sight. Two or three travellers with carrioles met
us afterwards, and looked at us with much curiosity as
they passed. The evening was fine and enjoyable; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
country on either side, was well wooded and mountainous.
The river Logan added much to the picturesque beauty
of the scene. Suddenly a carriole appeared behind us,
driven by one who was evidently bent on salmon fishing.
He wore a mackintosh, and had a south-wester over his
head. When any carriages appeared my gipsies immediately
got our donkeys in line along the side of the
road. Noah at the head of the first, Zachariah the
second, and Esmeralda led the third, so that they
were all kept well out of the way. The traveller’s
Norwegian pony seemed a little shy in passing us; but
the traveller was driving quietly by, as the donkeys were
halted, when down jumped the Skydskarl, and rushed to
the pony’s head, which was suddenly checked into the
road fence.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you doing, boy!” shouted the
driver, whose nationality was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Esmeralda went to the pony’s head. We could hardly
help laughing.</p>

<p>“Let go his head,” shouted our enraged countryman at
the boy. Poor fellow, he was too bewildered, and probably
did not understand English. With redoubled energy
as he stared at the donkeys, he kept pulling the pony’s
head against the fence, whilst Esmeralda was pulling the
contrary way. In vain the traveller urged the pony.
Wildly the Skydskarl held its head down.</p>

<p>“Get behind, boy,” shouted the traveller, “you’re
pulling back. He’s quiet enough&mdash;let go, boy!!”</p>

<p>At last the Skydskarl retreated in confusion to the
back of the carriole, half crying. The traveller was soon
out of his difficulty, and rapidly disappeared along the
road, apparently intent on his fishing expedition. Occasionally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
we came to a rural cottage, at one of which we
noticed a lamb, and a goat. Zachariah played a pretty
slow waltz, as we lounged along the road, all rather
sleepy and tired. There was something of pure romance,
and feeling, as we stood apart in spirit, and contemplated
our calvacade, pushing their way to some unknown camping
ground. There was our fine, strong, light-coloured
donkey, with its Jerusalem cross, carrying its heavy
packs with ease, stepping to the music of the bells on
its scarlet collar. There was something soothing in
those bells, timed by the animal’s movement. Then
followed the puro rye, and the tarno rye, contrasting in
colour. There was Zachariah walking by their side, now
and then performing, a slow waltz, to the tune he was
playing on his violin. However long the day, however
wet and disagreeable the weather, still his gleaming eyes
and merry ha! ha! dit a kei, the <i>tarno rye</i>, by gum, Mr.
Smith is going to <i>dell</i> (gip., give) <i>mandy</i> a <i>metramengery</i>
(gip., tea) this evening. Then came the tall form of
Noah with his Alpine stock, and deer-stalking hat, set
jauntily on one side. Noah was an admirable fellow for
loading and packing; he had much improved since our
campaign last summer; never out of temper, with plenty
of energy and determination. By our side walked
Esmeralda, in her long tweed cloak, fastened round her
waist, small hat and feather, and thick boots studded
with nails. Our guitar, in a light cover, was slung over
her shoulder, whilst we carried, in a light cover, made on
purpose, her tambourine, with our courier bag. Tall
and slim, with raven hair, and jet black eyes, about our
own height, the young gipsy girl had an indomitable
spirit. Sometimes she caught hold of our hand, so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
it might be more help to her, as we journeyed onwards,
for she had had no sleep the previous night, and was
much tired, all had been dreadfully bitten with mosquitos.
The log houses we came to, had their groups of
peasants waiting to see us. Some would run with
tumultuous haste, to be in time, and a red cap generally
appeared prominently as one of the number. They had
often a good-humoured smile on their countenances. It
was lovely scenery all the way, especially when we
reached the turning to “Venebrygden” and crossed a
rapid, broad stream, issuing from a rocky gorge, beneath
a lofty mountain, whose base to nearly its summit, was
covered with fir. An old man with a wallet came from a
log house, near the road, and we gave him a piece of
money. At length we came to a place we were told was
Listari. It was a large house of superior construction,
on the road side, with extensive buildings, and an
appearance of much comfort. Some heads appeared at
the windows as we approached. Then we heard the
sudden clatter of feet, running downstairs, to obtain a
nearer view of our party.</p>

<p>There was an excited rush. One gentleman stuck to
a front window commanding the road, and looked at us
with a curious, and amused expression of countenance.
The old man with the wallet joined us again, and we gave
him another piece of two shillings. He said something,
which we thought meant camping ground beyond, and
passed on. We were now anxious to camp. Coming
near Listad we noticed some unenclosed ground, rising in
a steep slope, to the base of some fine bold precipitous
rocks, close above the valley. The sloping ground was
steep, with little grass, covered with loose rocks and scattered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
birch-trees. A rough turf-way led apparently to a
first ridge, of lofty ground, immediately above the road.
Zachariah went up first, and hearing his peculiar gipsy
whistle, we all climbed the track, rough with uneven
grassy hillocks, studded with birch-trees, and sheltered by
rocks. In a small hollow, near a rough fence, at the
summit of the ridge, our donkeys were unloaded. It was
a beautiful camping ground for our night’s repose.

<p>No sooner had we unpacked, and our things were
under our waterproof, than a gorgio was announced. As
if by magic, a middle height, thick set man appeared
through some birch-trees. He hesitated, and did not
speak. Our silver-mounted flask was quickly drawn from
its plaid bag, and we handed him some aquavët. Silently
drinking, he nodded his head. Seeing the end of a pipe
sticking out of his waistcoat pocket, we offered him some
English tobacco, which he also took, and saying in a
whisper, “tak,” vanished as silently as he came. A fire
was lighted to boil the water, which Zachariah procured
from a torrent in the rocks above the camp. Metramengry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
consisted of tea, fried bacon, two small trout
caught at Vodvang, and bread. The rain suddenly commenced,
and it poured in torrents. Dark clouds gathered
thickly, as we sat at tea wrapped in our waterproof rugs.
Not long afterwards the silent man returned with three
others, who also had brandy. We pitched our tents in
the rain, and, thanks to our waterproof covering, our
things were kept tolerably dry.</p>

<p>The view was magnificent. The broad waters of the
Logan flowed in the valley below us. Islands in its
stream heightened the picturesque effect. A considerable
quantity of well wooded and grassy land formed the bed of
the valley. Pleasant bondegaards, or farms, extended to
the base of hills, crowned with forest. Beyond rose the
peaks of the wild Fjelds.</p>

<p>Esmeralda had quite recovered from her fatigue; Noah
was now quite well. Tea is a grand restorer of failing
energy. Esmeralda was at once active in our tent
arrangements. All things must have their place.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Smith, look sharp, or I must give you a
severe doing,” and Esmeralda’s dark eyes flashed fire, and
sparkled with merriment and witchery. Sometimes, when
we were a careless lounger about the tents, she would
say, “Dableau! you are going in and out, in and out,
and never doing anything.”</p>

<p>Then Noah might be heard, “What are you at, Zachariah;
can’t you see where you are going to? I think
you are making yourself too much of a man!” An observation
which Zachariah would answer with “Dawdy,
dawdy, fake your bosh;” and, making a succession of
droll faces, would skip about in the rain, singing, “Fem
de dura.” We will not answer for the correctness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Zachariah’s intended quotation from the Norwegian peasant
girl’s song we heard at our camp near Holmen.</p>

<p>More people came wandering about, some looking at
our donkeys and others staring at our tents. They were
all of the peasant class, kind, homely-looking people. It
was about a quarter to 7 o’clock when we encamped.
Taking our places in our tents at about 9 o’clock we
commenced our gipsy Norwegian song, with guitar and
violin accompaniment. Then followed our song, “Farewell;”
afterwards dance music, violin and tambourine.
A tolerable number of peasants were seated on the bank
opposite the entrance to the tent. They sat in the rain
on the wet grass until we had finished. After much
talking, in which the female voices certainly predominated,
they shouted “Farvel.” The interest they seemed to
take in our music was most amusing. They had such
smiling countenances. One young peasant girl especially
kept looking at each by turns, and then laughing, until
we could hardly help relaxing our expression of <i>insouciance</i>.
As they departed, a peasant kindly suggested a
better spot for the donkeys to graze than where the gipsies
had first put them. Music being over, we all retired to
bed. Just as we were dozing away, Zachariah’s voice
was heard: “Mr. Smith, sir!”</p>

<p>“What do you want, Zachariah?”</p>

<p>“I have got your key and pencil, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, go to sleep!”</p>

<p>“But, sir, you can’t unlock your box without it. You
must have it, sir. Otta clocken, more music, ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Then we heard scratch, scratch wildly at work, and
presently Zachariah’s voice: “I can’t stand it! I cannot
stand it any longer; these skeato’s will kill me!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>We must say our sleep was sound and undisturbed
until half-past 6 o’clock. Much rain had fallen in the
night. It was the first of July. Noah lighted the fire,
and boiled the water. Two men came to our camp and
had some brandy whilst we conversed with them in
broken Norwegian. One was a traveller from Christiania.
We told them that if they came again we should play our
music at 8 o’clock in the evening. As we took our
breakfast of tea, bread and butter, and potted meat, stray
parties of peasants watched us with much interest. We
gave several small children some biscuits. An intelligent
peasant came and asked a variety of questions about the
donkeys. Another brought his wife and children. A
large party came before our dinner at 1 o’clock, and a
short stout, well-dressed man, with a turban cap, discussed
in an animated manner various matters connected with
the donkey race. Their voices seemed constantly to
mingle with our ideas as we wrote a letter to the gipsies’
friends, in which Esmeralda inclosed some beautiful wild
flowers.</p>

<p>We sent Noah and Zachariah to the river to fish for
dinner. When they were gone, a peasant boy came up
with a large sack of hay, which he gave the donkeys.
We were touched by his attention; for some time he
silently watched them. Before he left we gave him a
copy of our gipsies’ Norwegian song. He took us by the
hand, and looked with such a kindly expression in our
face, that we could not help feeling that the world, after
all, was not so bad as we had thought it. As a substitute
for vegetables, crystals of citric acid, dissolved in
water, were occasionally taken by ourselves and the
gipsies. Noah and Zachariah were full of fun when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
came back from fishing at 1 o’clock, having caught six
small roach and perch.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Zachariah, “Mr. Smith, I know
some good flies for my fishing this evening. All right,
sir;” and he danced a war dance on the turf till he fell
backwards over a birch tree stump, to the great amusement
of himself and the peasants who were watching us
with continuous interest.</p>

<p>We had tea, fish, and balivas (gip. for bacon) for
dinner. Sugar was a source of difficulty. In putting the
sugar first into each pannikin before the tea was poured
out, Zachariah was not considered an example of economy.
Not that we were inclined to limit very strictly
his penchant for it, but we were not sure where we
might be able to get more when our stock was finished.</p>

<p>Esmeralda was busy. We were writing. Noah therefore
officiated, whilst Zachariah, with a look of injured
innocence, stood by, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall not have anything more to do with the
goodlo” (gip. for sugar); a resolution we entirely agreed
to.</p>

<p>Still Zachariah often had more than any of us, which he
would occasionally acknowledge with “Thank you, sir,”
“God bless you,” “Quite enough, sir,” as he stirred it
up in his pannikin with an air of extreme satisfaction.</p>

<p>The bacon and fish at dinner were excellent; we hardly
knew which was best. A peasant boy brought us a
bundle of sticks for our fire. The sun became exceedingly
hot. Esmeralda and myself went and sat in some shade
near our tents. Zachariah found a shady corner under
some rocks. Noah first looked out a few things in his
tent for Esmeralda to wash. Then he afterwards stood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
in the shade of a birch tree, blacking his boots, and observed
to Esmeralda&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall not help my wife as Mr. Smith does you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Esmeralda, “what is a wife for?”</p>

<p>“For?” retorted Noah sharply, giving his boot an
extra brush, “why, to wait upon her husband.”</p>

<p>“And what,” said Esmeralda, “is a husband for?”</p>

<p>“What’s a husband for?” exclaimed Noah, with a
look of profound pity for his sister’s ignorance, “why, to
eat and drink, and look on.”</p>

<p>It would seem to us that the more rude energy a man
has in his composition, the more a woman will be made
take her position as helpmate. It is always a mark of
great civilization, and the effeminacy of a people, when
women obtain the undue mastery of men.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> When Noah
had finished blacking his boots, he went with Zachariah
to take the donkeys for water along the road towards
Listad As they turned, Noah and Zachariah astonished
the peasants by racing along the road mounted on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
donkeys, with their faces to their tails. Noah and
Zachariah afterwards went fishing.</p>

<p>We lounged on an eminence writing our notes, and
Esmeralda washed for us a shirt and collar, and some of
her own and Noah’s things. We had a succession of
visitors all the afternoon. Some wore red caps; all were
deeply interested in the donkeys. In fact, if we could
have kept them secluded in a tent, we might have made
a large fortune by exhibiting them. We had, however,
no wish to do so. Our peasant friends were welcome,
and if our wild music gave them pleasure, they were
welcome to that also. They certainly showed us much
civility and kindness during our wanderings. We cannot
forget them.</p>

<p>When we were at the tents at 6 o’clock, Zachariah
had returned with two small fishes, and Noah with one of
tolerable size. Having made a hurried tea, a large
number of peasants collected, before 8 o’clock, about
our camp. The music commenced at our tents soon
afterwards, and then to give them an opportunity to
dance, we went outside. There was a good space of
ground close below our tents, but a tree was in the
middle of the ground. This was at last uprooted by the
peasants. Our beau of the village on this occasion was a
thin, rather roughly-dressed, young man, but an inveterate
dancer. The gipsies at once named him Arthur. If
a house had interfered with the convenience of the dancers
instead of a tree, it is possible that he would have pulled
that down also. Of the females, two small girls were the
best dancers; and they seemed thoroughly to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>The dancers patronised the skip waltz. It was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
curious scene. Three or four of the peasants were
dressed in blue jackets with silver buttons and silver
frontlets hanging from their necks.</p>

<p>My gipsies were particularly lively and in high spirits.
The variety of costume, and any slight eccentricity of
manner, was at once the subject of their criticism. We
did our best to moderate their gaiety, and romany chaff,
now and then as they played their wild music, we could
hear.</p>

<p>“Dit a kei! (gip., look there) there’s Arthur!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha; no it isn’t Arthur; that’s Johnny!”</p>

<p>“Ah, the sapeau (gip., snake)! Why, he’s got Crafty
Jemmy’s nose!”</p>

<p>“Dik the gorgio in Uncle Sam’s stardy (gip., hat)!”</p>

<p>“Oh nei! oh nei! What are you a salin (gip., laughing)
at?” “It’s our Elijah vellin (gip., coming) from
Bosbury, a seaport town in the middle of England. Look
at his chokas (gip., shoes)! Hasn’t he got bongy mouee
(gip., ugly mouth)!”</p>

<p>“Dik that fellow’s swagler (gip., pipe)!”</p>

<p>“Arthur can dance! Now Arthur’s a-going it! Well
done, Arthur!!”</p>

<p>Bang-bang went the tambourine, as the beau of the
village whirled his partner round, to the admiration of the
surrounding throng. There was no harm meant by our
gipsies’ chaff. If anyone present had wanted their assistance,
they would have been the first to give it them. It
was quite impossible for them to remain quiet; naturally
impulsive and gay, they must laugh in their lightsome
moods. There were some young ladies, and apparently
their brother, sitting near.</p>

<p>As we were standing with Esmeralda at our tents,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
whilst Noah and Zachariah were playing, a dark thick-set,
heavy-featured old woman pressed through the throng
round us. She had all the appearance of a gipsy, when
she suddenly shook Esmeralda by the hand. We thought
she was a Norwegian Zigeuner. Then she took hold of
Esmeralda’s large necklace, and tried to take it off, before
she could recover from her surprise. Immediately we saw
what she was doing, we pulled her away, and she retired
in silence through the crowd. We saw her afterwards,
sitting on a bank, watching us.</p>

<p>It is ten o’clock, and our music ends, saying, “God
nat (Nor., good night), god folk (Nor., good people).” We
retired to our tent. Most of our visitors left. One young
gentleman, who spoke English, said to Noah outside our
tents, “A little more music.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, sir,” said Noah. “The master never has
any playing after ten. You should have come before,
sir.”</p>

<p>The young gentleman who had the young ladies with
him then asked Noah what time we went in the morning.</p>

<p>“At 9 o’clock, sir,” said Noah.</p>

<p>One of the young ladies then inquired in English if
Noah could tell fortunes.</p>

<p>“No,” said Noah; which no doubt was a matter of
great disappointment.</p>

<p>Then the gentleman asked Noah his sister’s name.</p>

<p>“Agnes,” said Noah.</p>

<p>What next will he tell them, thought we, being
anxious for him to go to bed.</p>

<p>Then one of the young ladies asked his sister’s age;
and Noah told her sixteen. Then he was asked who we
were. Not knowing how long they would stay&mdash;for we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
had to rise early next morning, and knowing that any
curiosity would only get wide answers from Noah&mdash;we
went out, explaining that we had to travel early, and we
liked all in camp to go to bed in good time. They did
not say much, but, wishing us good evening, they all left.
The young gentleman spoke very good English. We
were still troubled with a number of children, making a
noise about our tents, until after eleven, instead of going
when the music ended at ten o’clock. At last all was
silence.</p>

<p>We were up the next morning at half-past 1 o’clock,
enjoyed a good wash, lighted a fire, and had Noah and
Zachariah up about 2 o’clock. We were anxious to
give them all the rest possible; Esmeralda was called
the last. For frokost, we had tea, fish, bread, and potted-meat;
Esmeralda and myself had some citric-acid afterwards.
Our donkeys were nearly loaded, and ready to
start at 5 o’clock. We were just having a romp with
Esmeralda and her two brothers, as we were packing up
our things, and a merry laugh, when some men appeared
at the fence near our camping-ground. They seemed
much astonished, and rather disconcerted; probably, they
expected to find us asleep. They lifted their hats, and
soon afterwards left. Our donkeys loaded, we looked
carefully round to see that we had collected all our
effects. The main road was soon gained, when we
descended from the steep ridge on which we had camped.
We had now travelled more than five Norse miles from
Lillehammer, or thirty-five English miles, as we proceed
quietly along the road from Listad.</p>

<p>We could never tire of the beautiful valley of the
Logan. Our mode of travel gave us ample opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
to study its varied scenery. At any points of interest
we could halt, without the thought of being behind-time
at the next post station, or of being reminded by
the Skydskarl that we were lingering too long. It was
about seven o’clock; the morning was very sunny and
pleasant as we came to a place said to be Tresgone.
The name is not marked in our map. Noah and
Zachariah went to a small log-house, near a mill, at the
foot of a gorge, to purchase bread and butter. Directly
the woman saw them, she shut the door with considerable
haste; their Alpine stocks had created a sudden
alarm. After reconnoitring them through her window,
confidence was restored; she opened the door and did a
stroke of business, selling us four loaves for fifteen skillings.
A man on horseback, with white hair, kept with
us occasionally for some miles; he had, naturally, white
hair, like an Albino, and not the result of age. For
some distance, at different points on the road, the
peasants hurried from their work, and, with anxious
faces, struggled to be in time to see our party pass;
sometimes, an aged man, with serious weather-beaten
face, wearing a red cap on his head, was awkwardly
scrambling towards the road-fence, followed by a woman
and children. At other times, two or three men would
race along the road-fence and take up their position at
some distance before us, waiting the moment when we
should pass. In fact, at times, we almost felt as if we
were marching past the saluting-point, leading a company
at a review, though the group of peasants differed
much from a staff of officers at a saluting-point; we had,
nevertheless, to stand the test of what appeared to be a
close and scrutinizing examination of our company.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>At one time, Noah played his violin as he sauntered
along. Occasionally, Zachariah was a short distance
in advance, with the donkeys, and the peasants collected
at the road side, would politely take their hats off to him,
an honour Zachariah appeared much to appreciate. We
reached Branvold,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and at a station on the road side, we
found we could post our letters. The house was remarkably
clean and comfortable, and had, apparently,
excellent accommodation. The civil pige found us a pen
and ink, and went to call her young mistress, who had
not yet left her room. We met a gentleman staying
there who had been passenger on board the steamer on
the Mjösen Lake; he went out to look at the donkeys.
The young post mistress took our letters; one letter was
to the gipsies’ friends. She was a very agreeable,
pleasant-looking girl, who spoke English with an
admirable accent. We paid eight skillings, which she
said the postage would amount to. Soon after we had
left the station she came running to us, and said,
“Mr. Smith, it is sixteen skillings;” and received the
money. Shortly after, she came driving up in her
carriole, and said, “Mr. Smith, I find it is sixteen skillings
more.” In truth, we were not sorry to see her again,
she was such a kind, pleasant, merry girl, withal neatly
dressed, and good-looking. We laughed, as we held out
the palm of our hand containing a number of Norwegian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
coins that she might count out what she wanted; nor
did we omit to pay a just tribute to her knowledge of the
English language. After the young post mistress had
left us, we came along the road towards a large house,
having more of those characteristics of the country
gentleman’s residence than any we had yet seen. The
house stood in its own grounds, at a short distance before
we reached the turning from the main route to “Harpe
Brö.” When we passed by it, the gentleman and his
family were assembled near the entrance-gate to the
grounds. He was a fine, tall, gentlemanly man, accompanied
by a very good-looking young lady, who stood
near him. She was the best-looking young lady we had
yet seen in Norway. Two young gentlemen, we supposed
to be sons, were also there.</p>

<p>The gentleman lifted his hat, and seemed to give us a
kindly welcome; we returned his salutation. There was
something pleasurable in such kindly feeling; we little
think how much we can do in this world to lighten a
lonely wayfarer’s heart.

<p>We had not gone far along the road, when we saw a
blacksmith’s shop; a man suddenly appeared from it, and
came towards us on a velocipede.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Esmeralda, “there’s a <i>velocity</i>”!</p>

<p>“What broad wheels,” said Zachariah.</p>

<p>“It’s Arthur coming to town,” answered Noah.</p>

<p>The man was working it along might and main, with
his hair flying; he was a strong framed man, with an
intelligent countenance. The velocipede was probably
manufactured by himself; although very roughly made, he
managed to go at a fair pace; when we came to the
route turning from the main road to “Harpe Brö”
our companion with the naturally white hair, who had
occasionally ridden with us during the morning, and by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
whose assistance we had increased our vocabulary of
Norwegian words, wished us good day.</p>

<p>At a short distance beyond the blacksmith’s shop, as
our donkeys were in advance, they strayed off the road
into an open fir wood. Two young ladies, and a man
had followed us for a short distance; they seemed to
think we were going to halt in the wood, and as they stood
watching us, we thought they seemed disappointed, when
the donkeys were driven back to the road, and continued
their journey. It was rather too early in the day for rest.
Sauntering quietly along, we at length came to an open
space having a wooden seat; this accommodation we
particularly noticed in Norway at some points on the wayside.
Generally, in a pleasant romantic spot, the ground
is gravelled from the road, and a long wooden seat is
placed for the convenience, and rest of the weary wayfarer.
In selecting this spot, care is taken that it is near
water, and close by, we usually found a deliciously clear
stream, to slake the travellers’ thirst. On this occasion
we at once commenced unloading our baggage near the
wooden seat, and as we did not intend to remain very
long, Noah left the pockets girthed on two of the
donkeys, who soon after wandered off to graze.</p>

<p>When we looked round we were struck with the
beauty of the scene. Not far above us, on the opposite
side the road, a log cottage stood lonely on the side of a
steep rising hill. A brawling stream passed underneath
the road near us; we saw it again, as it issued from a
narrow brick arch, and was soon lost in the bushes of the
declivity, which formed the bank of the Logan just below.</p>

<p>The picturesque summit of a mountain closed the
narrow valley from the world beyond.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>Leaving our things by the seat, we went down to the
stream at the arch below the road, and crossed to a small
patch of green sward on the other side. It was quiet and
sheltered, and our fire was soon lighted. Tea, sardines,
bread and cheese, formed our repast. A woman from
the log cottage came down and stood near looking at
us. We gave some biscuits to a small child in her
arms; Zachariah was sent off to fish. It was about 10
o’clock when we arrived; the view was charming; Noah
lounged on the grass with the violin; as he was tuning
it up, a young man came and leaned over the rails of the
road above, in silent contemplation. He is expecting
some music. You little think, my young friend, the treat
you are going to have, thought we. When Noah began
to scrape, the effect was marvellous; we turned, and the
young man was gone. The sounds ceased, for Noah
himself fell asleep. Esmeralda had a very fair voice.
It was pleasant to hear her sing at times, as we walked
along the winding valley of the Gudbransdalen. Now we
amused ourselves talking by the camp fire, and as we
reclined on our waterproofs, we wrote down at her
dictation, one of her ballads: “The Little Gipsy,” with
the addition of a few words, by a gipsy aunt, where
Esmeralda’s memory had failed. We now give the song
in its entirety. It has been long a favourite with the
country people.</p>

<p>Two men with carts passed whilst we were resting,
and they halted to look at our donkeys.</p>

<p>It was nearly 2 o’clock, when myself and Noah went
up to the wooden seat to load the animals. As we were
standing by our things, a carriage passed, a gentleman
driving with apparently his son, asked if we were going to
camp there, we told him we were going on; He asked how
many miles we travelled in a day, and we answered fourteen
or fifteen. They wished us a pleasant excursion, we
wished him <i>bon voyage</i>, and, lifting our hats, he drove on.
Two donkeys were packed, and Noah brought up the
third. Where’s the pocket? said Noah, looking rather wild.
“Pocket?” said we, “isn’t it among the things?” No, sir,
we never took it off; “it must have slipt off somewhere.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
In fact, we had not taken the pockets off two of the
donkeys, but one pocket had been pushed off by the Puru
Rawnee, against the road rails, whilst we were at lunch,
and Noah had placed it by the seat; what had become of
the other we could not tell; we both went some distance
along the road where they had been browsing, but could
not find it. Esmeralda was much enraged. All her
things with Noah and Zachariah’s scanty stock, and their
sheets, tent blankets, and sleeping blankets, were also in
the lost pocket. We went up to the house, and managed
to explain to two women the position we were in. Noah
said: “Sir, it must have been taken off, for there is no mark
on the road where it has come down.” Esmeralda fixed
her suspicions on the unfortunate cart drivers, who had
been looking at the donkeys; we repudiated the idea,
and said they were driving the wrong way to have done
so. A vigorous search was made, with the help of the
younger peasant woman, amongst the bushes of the steep
bank, between the road and the river, where the two
donkeys had been also wandering, but no pocket could
be found.</p>

<p>We decided to go on. To the young peasant girl, who
seemed as anxious as ourselves for its recovery, we gave
a mark, and an address, so that the pocket, if found,
might be sent to Nystuen, to the “Herren mit drei
asen.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Esmeralda rode one donkey, and in no very
enviable frame of mind, we hurried along at a rapid
pace.</p>

<p>Noah exclaimed, “I could sit down and cry, sir. I
don’t want no tea&mdash;I can’t eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can,” said Esmeralda, boiling with indignation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
“I know it is taken; we shall never see it again.
My small smoothing-iron, I would not have parted with
it for anything, I have had it so long; and my dress&mdash;”
and she half gave way to a flood of tears. “It will do
them as has taken it no good.”</p>

<p>Zachariah had just joined us from the river without
a fish.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, in a weeping tone, “my pretty dicklo
(gip. handkerchief) is gone.”</p>

<p>I believe this handkerchief constituted nearly the whole
strength of his wardrobe.</p>

<p>“It is fortunate,” said we, “both pockets were not
lost. We must manage as well as we can; some shelter
is left, and all our provisions. It might have been worse.
You shall have more blankets, Noah. We are quite
sure the pocket has not been taken; they are honest in
Norway&mdash;far more honest than most other countries we
have travelled.”</p>

<p>So we pushed along till we saw a blacksmith, and
two other men standing at the road side. We explained
our loss to them as well as we could. They
pointed to a fir wood above us as a convenient camping-ground,
but we wanted to proceed on our journey, and
went on. At the next place we came to, we purchased
four loaves of bread for fifteen skillings. At
one large house we passed, near the road side, a large
number of persons were assembled, probably at some
fête. There was a general rush to see us. When we
came to a large wooden water trough on the road side,
some girls who saw us, ran down the meadow above;
they were great loosely-dressed peasant girls, who
laughed at us immoderately.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>“What are the sapeaus (gip. snakes) crying about?”
said Esmeralda, in no very good temper.</p>

<p>At any other time she would have laughed with them.</p>

<p>“Ah! the Bongy mouees” (gip. ugly mouths), shouted
Zachariah. “They were tolerably well slap-dashed in
Romany, as I have no doubt we were good-humouredly
in Norwegian.”</p>

<p>We had not gone many yards from the water trough,
when the young woman we had seen at our mid-day
halt, came running round a corner of the road. She
seemed half fainting and exhausted, and, staggering to
the water-trough when she saw us, she dashed some
water over her face, and hurriedly drank some. We at
once stopped the donkeys, and the girls above the road
ceased laughing. They seemed puzzled at the scene.
We went to the poor girl, who said, when she was able
to speak, she had found the pocket, which had slipped
off the donkey close to the river’s edge. It was lucky it
had not rolled in. Being satisfied from the things she
found inside the pocket, that it belonged to us, she had
followed us with it, and at last left it at some place on
the road, so that she might more quickly overtake us.
It was decided that Noah would take one of the donkeys,
and go back with the peasant girl for the pocket. We were
profuse in our thanks to her; she was a good, honest girl.
We don’t think our gipsies will ever again believe, that such
a thing as dishonesty, is possible in Norway. Pulling out
a large handful of money from our pocket, we pressed it
into the girl’s hands. She wished to give part back; it
was too much, she did not like to take it all. We would
have no denial; as she was returning she took out her
handkerchief in which she had placed the money, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
again offered us part; she did not like to take so much.
We made her put it back. Under such circumstances
what cared we what the sum was; we felt inclined
to give her all we possessed, she had been so honest.
How much inconvenience we might have experienced,
but for the activity and kindness of this Norwegian
peasant girl. Shaking her heartily by the hand, she
returned with Noah. We may never meet again; we
do not even know her name. Yet there is a world
beyond this. May her fate be with the blessed of a
future and eternal life. Continuing our route, we left
behind us <i>Burre</i>, and the turn to <i>Kvikne</i>. It may easily
be imagined we went along in much better spirits; all
was sunshine. Noah would follow with the lost pocket,
and find us in our camping-ground. Patrins,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> intelligible
to our gipsy party, were strewed as we went along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the road. Pieces of grass,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> to all appearance scattered
carelessly along the route, yet they had a meaning, and a
language which a gipsy easily reads. The points of
the grass indicated the way we took.</p>

<p>Although anxious to finish our day’s journey, we could
find no convenient camping-ground. We met the gentleman
we had conversed with in the morning. His son
descended from the carriage to lead the horse by the
donkeys. Kindly salutations were exchanged. Noah
said that when the gentleman afterwards met him, he
said, “Your master seems a pleasant gentleman.”</p>

<p>“‘Well, sir, he’s always the same,’ I answered, and
the son gave me a cigar, whilst the gentleman sent his
kind regards to you, sir.”</p>

<p>Our camp rules were relaxed, and Noah was of
course allowed on this occasion to smoke. We continued
our way up a narrow gorge between high mountains, but
did not find any convenient camping-ground. In the
distance we saw log houses near the river Logan. These
were Storklevstad, Viig, and Qvam. As we descended
the road we noticed a rough narrow way on our right,
with a telegraph post in the centre. Zachariah went
and reported that it led to a large common extending
to mountains beyond. Esmeralda and myself were at
first inclined to continue our route. As we were considering,
a young man having the appearance of a
carpenter came by, and we asked him if we could camp
there. He said “Ya, ya,” and the lane being too narrow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
and awkward for the donkeys to go up loaded, the man
helped us, very kindly, to unload our heavy packs, and
assisted us to carry them to a rock on the common; we
gave him two demi vers of brandy. The distance we had
travelled had been long, the weather seemed inclined for
rain, and we were glad to get in for night quarters.
This corner of the common was bounded by hedges.
Under a thick high hedge on the common side we made
a fire, and our tea was soon ready, with ham fried in oil,
and bread. Noah came in time for tea, and, selecting a
camping-ground on the common, put up the tent-rods.
The moorland, extending up a mountain, was covered
with large masses of rock and low bushes. Visitors soon
came. An old man with a wallet gave our donkeys
some bread whilst we were at tea, and we gave him
some brandy. Women and children came, and were
very civil. Our tents were soon pitched, and arranged,
and our things carefully stowed away. The waterproof
was so placed over our tents, that our visitors were obliged
to sit down, in order to see us through the opening.</p>

<p>Noah searched for his tambourine, but it could not be
found, to his consternation; we came to the conclusion
that it must have been left on the hedge bank near the
water trough. Noah was loud in his lamentation, when
a peasant suddenly brought it to the tent. We had
left it where we supposed, and the peasant honestly
restored the tambourine. We gave him a good recompense
with many thanks, though he did not seem to wish any
money reward. We had seldom met such kindly people.
Gladly we commenced playing our music, and having recovered
all our things, we were much pleased to find
ourselves in a comfortable camping-ground for the night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Scarcely had we commenced playing, than the crowd of
people increased round our tents. It was as much as we
could do to keep them from crushing the tents in. One
little man in spectacles, and a curious turned-up hat,
with a knowing comical expression of countenance, came
crawling into our tent on all fours. First he looked up
at Noah, then at Zachariah, then at Esmeralda, and then
at myself. We did not stop our playing. He put up
his finger as a signal for us to stop, but we could not
interrupt the tune. Then he expectorated freely on the
intervening space in our tents; fortunately, that part
was only turf, but the absence of saliva was at all
times preferred. Then he stared curiously through his
spectacles, being still on his hands and knees. Some
village magnate, thought we. Then he suddenly summoned
all his energy, and asked loudly all kinds of questions
in Norwegian, whilst we continued our music. We
thought he was slightly intoxicated, but it may have been
an eccentricity of manner. He seemed to know some
words of English. Noah said “Don’t know” to most
questions. We could distinguish the word Tater, and Noah
said “shoemaker,” and nodding at Zachariah, “cobbler.”
Then he addressed some question to ourself, to which we
answered “Nei, nei.” “Jeg gaae Romsdalen,” still persevering,
he pointed to Esmeralda, who was rattling her
tambourine, and he seemed specially anxious to know
what part she took in the economy of the tents. At
last he was quiet for a short time, and some one who
did not like his attempted interruption of the music,
pulled him out by his legs. Alas! he soon returned,
crawling in again to the tent, expectorating as usual.
Noah seemed his grand point of attack. Addressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Noah, he pointed to us with a look of triumphant discovery,
and said, “Artistique,” but Noah did not seem
to comprehend.</p>

<p>We are afraid his pertinacity met with very little reward.
A considerable number of persons continued round
our tents, and we finished music towards 10 o’clock. Then
our visitors wanted more music. It was very complimentary
to our musical talent, but we did not play after
10 o’clock. One young man who spoke some English,
came to us, and asked to have more music. We explained
that we had been up at 2 o’clock that morning,
and did not allow music after 10 o’clock, and wanted to go
to bed. Our visitors did not go for some time, but kept
talking, and making a noise, until nearly 11, when we
gladly fell asleep.</p>

<p>Another Sunday. We welcomed the day as we ate our
breakfast of tea, potted meat, and bread. Then the word
was given that the gorgios<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> were a vellin. Many visitors
soon collected, who were so curious, that one of our party
had to stand at the entrance to the tents during the
morning. A young man in long riding boots and horseman’s
cloak, with a whip in his hand, speaking English
and German, informed us that an English captain would
shortly pass if we liked to see him. We said if he were
going to Lillehammer he might render us a service. An
intelligent young Norwegian peasant said he would let
us know, when the captain came along the road. We
conversed some portion of the morning with our visitors,
and added to our knowledge of Norsk language.</p>

<p>At last the young Norwegian came and said the captain
was come. We took Noah and the young peasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
with us, and started towards the village of “Qvam.”
After a sharp walk we reached a post station on the road
side near the river, and leaving Noah and the peasant in
the large kitchen with a bottle of “Baiersk Öl,” we went
into an inner room to see the captain.</p>

<p>The officer, whom we expected to find an Englishman,
was Norwegian. The French language was at once our
medium of communication. We quickly explained that we
had lost two hats between the Honnefos and Moshuus, and
if <i>en passant</i> he heard of them, we were anxious to have
them forwarded to Nystuen, and a handsome reward would
be given. He looked at our route on the map. Monsieur
le Capitaine was just going to dinner; a fine pink trout
was served up. The captain asked us if we were going
to dine, but was informed that our dinner waited us at
the camp. He said he should be happy to inquire, and
should meet us next morning, when he was returning.
The captain spoke French very well, and at first sight
we should have taken him for a French officer. There
was a gentlemanly frankness about him which pleased us.
Although not tall, he was of compact build, strong, and
energetic, much indication of prompt and rapid action&mdash;one
prone to vigour of thought, and quickness of decision.
He possessed the bearing of a military man. We regretted
we could not see more of him. Giving him our card,
and shaking hands, we parted.</p>

<p>Noah and the Norwegian were allowed another bottle
of “Baiersk Öl” on our return to the kitchen, and taking
a sip to drink “gamle norge,” we immediately left.</p>

<p>The peasant returned with us. At a short distance
from our camp, the village magnate came forth from a
house, still wearing his curious turned-up hat. The little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
man seemed rather pleased to see us. As he advanced
with a comical expression of countenance, he appeared to
have something of importance to communicate. We
politely paused a moment. He wanted to&mdash;to&mdash;“sell us
a cheese!”</p>

<p>The peasant took a share of our dinner which was
ready in camp. We were obliged to take our dinner
inside our tents, on account of the number of visitors.
They were never absent. It was a matter of conjecture
whether they ever ate anything themselves; they seemed
to be at our camp from morning till night. Our sensations
were probably similar to those formerly experienced
by the lions in Wombwell’s well-known menagerie, when
viewed at feeding time.</p>

<p>Esmeralda had the soup ready, which consisted of
white beans, pea flour, rice, and Liebig’s essence of
meat. Our peasant, as he sat on the grass near us,
with his bowl of soup, seemed thoroughly to enjoy it.
We gave him some English Cheddar cheese, from
Hudson Bros., which seemed to astonish him; and we
heard him say to our interested visitors “meget godt”
(very good).</p>

<p>Whilst we had been absent, one young fellow, who
spoke a little English, came to our tents, and presuming
too far upon Esmeralda’s good nature, received a severe
blow on the shoulder with a stick, which shut him up.
Probably to raise his spirits, he asked Zachariah to give
him some of his master’s brandy, which resulted in a
sharp answer, and he left the camp.</p>

<p>During dinner time a large number of visitors carefully
watched our smallest movements. We had no
idea we could possibly meet with so much solicitude as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
evinced, by the good people of Storklevestad, Viig, and
Qvam.</p>

<p>After dinner, leaving our gipsies in charge of the tents,
we retired to the mountain, to enjoy some quietude, and
contemplation. How we watched the beautiful scene
before us! The Blaa Fjeld, and the picturesque river
Logan! The nature of this world, as God made it, is
ever beautiful. Who can tire of its contemplation?</p>

<p>When we returned at 6 o’clock, throngs of visitors&mdash;as
a German would say, “Immer! Immer!”&mdash;were
grouped about the tents. Esmeralda was at the fire preparing
for tea, with several young fellows buzzing about
her. We seemed to come like a cloud upon their sunshine.
Their fun was harmless, but obstructive to our
chances for the next meal. Esmeralda was sent into the
tents to get the tea things ready. Noah soon brought
the tea, and we did not go out again. Our visitors wandered
about round and round our tents, sometimes gazing
at the donkeys, then returning, till about half-past 10,
when they all left.</p>

<p>How calm and quiet the Norwegian night, when the
hum of voices is hushed! How delightful, as we looked
forth from our tents! Then we distinguished three
figures gliding over the moorland towards us. They approached;
it was about 11 o’clock. There was the
bright-eyed, good-looking Pige, whom we had noticed at
our tents during the day, without shoes or stockings.
Now she had some stockings on, probably borrowed from
some friend, to give her a more respectable appearance.
She was followed by a little boy and girl; and as she
hovered near our tents, she pointed to Noah, and then
towards her cottage in the distance. She made love by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
signs. In vain we wished her “good night.” Poor girl!
She still lingered, sometimes pointing to herself, and then
towards the village.</p>

<p>We were just going out to persuade her to go home,
when Esmeralda asked, why we should trouble ourselves
about her.</p>

<p>“Why should we?” We at once gave up the diplomatic
mission. Zachariah was sent outside the tents
instead, and made signals for her to go. Smiling, she
said, in a clear, pleasant voice, “Farvel, adieu!” and,
kissing her hand, left.</p>

<p>Oh, no! she was quickly back again, followed by her
Lilliputian retinue, who floundered after her among the
rocks. There she lingered like the siren of the Rhine.
Noah was fortunately spell-bound in his tent. Who
knows, if he had gone, he may at this moment have been,
a denizen of Storklevestad! She again seemed going
from our tents.</p>

<p>Thank goodness! we are now quiet. Vain delusion!
“Farvel, adieu!” She was again standing on a rock near
our tents. How she lingered! Perhaps Noah might
change his mind. “Farvel, adieu!” we said. “Farvel,
adieu!” the gipsies shouted. She loved&mdash;she lingered.
Noah came not. At last she went; but we could see
her, as she went across the moorland, at times turn, and
stand irresolute; till the very last, “Farvel, adieu!” of
the Norwegian peasant girl died upon the wind, and we
all went to sleep.

<p>The next morning was fine, but dull. We were up at
half-past 1 o’clock, and decided to try the artificial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
minnow. The trout we had seen the day previous served
up for the captain’s dinner no doubt occasioned the
resolution.</p>

<p>The Logan was close at hand. Esmeralda’s soup was
warmed up for frokost. Our things were afterwards all
carried down into the main road. Noah went for the
donkeys to load them, and we fished along the Logan to
Qvam. How still and quiet all appeared at Storklevestad,
Viig, and Qvam! Not a soul stirring! As we fished
towards Qvam, we saw inscribed on a large stone on the
road side near the river&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza caption">
<span>Her blev Skotternes anfœrer<br /></span>
<span>George Sinclair<br /></span>
<span>Begraven efterat<br /></span>
<span>Han var falden<br /></span>
<span>ved Kringelen den<br /></span>
<span>26 August,<br /></span>
<span>1812.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a><br /></span>
</span></span>
</p>

<p>Our fishing resulted in the loss of our artificial minnow,
no sport, and we put up our tackle. The Qvam churchyard
on the right of the road was near us. Our party had
not come up. Then we strolled round the church which,
as usual, was built of wood, with very large porches.
Flowers had been placed on one grave. It is here that
Col. George Sinclair is buried. In 1812, Col. Sinclair
landed on a farm near Veblungsnœs, in Romsdalen, in
command of nine hundred Scotch troops. They marched
towards Sweden to aid Gustavus Adolphus against Christian
IV. King of Denmark.</p>

<p>At a hill called the Kringelen, beyond Qvam, near
Solheim, the peasants rolled down large quantities of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
rocks on his troops, who were either crushed to death,
drowned in the river below, or killed by the peasants
who attacked them when in disorder. Only two are said
to have survived.</p>

<p>We have never seen any minute particulars of the
tragic end of this military expedition. It is said that a
young lady, hearing that one of her own sex was with the
Scotch, sent her lover for her protection. Unfortunately,
as he approached, Mrs. Sinclair mistook his object, and
shot him dead.</p>

<p>The other Scotch and Dutch troops, who landed at
Thronjhem, reached Stockholm, and helped the Swedish
King to conclude advantageous terms of peace. What
became of Mrs. Sinclair, we do not know; or where the
Scotch soldiers were buried. The colonel seems to have
been a bold and daring man. The Norwegian peasants
gave their enemy a quiet resting place in the pleasant
churchyard of Qvam, and his melancholy history is
another illustration of the uncertainty of human hope.</p>

<p>Soon after 6 o’clock Noah, Zachariah, and Esmeralda
came up with the donkeys. Noah was limping along
very lame. In taking one of the donkeys to be loaded,
the animal slipped over a rock and fell across his leg.
Noah walked with difficulty, and was very sleepy&mdash;in
fact, when we had left Qvam, and the sun became warm,
we could scarcely keep our eyes open as we pushed on
along the road as fast as we could for several miles.</p>

<p>At a turn of the road, some distance from Qvam, we
saw a number of men without uniform marching towards
us. Zachariah was at first rather frightened. The men
advancing took up nearly the whole of the road.</p>

<p>Our friend, Monsieur le Capitaine, was marching at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the head of his men, who were going to their periodical
militia training. We were looking out to see which side
the road to take, when Monsieur le Capitaine opened out
his men right and left, and we passed through their centre,
which afforded them ample opportunity of observing our
cavalcade.</p>

<p>“Bon jour, Monsieur Smith,” said the Captain; “pleasant
journey.”</p>

<p>We also wished him “bon jour,” and with mutual
salutations each passed on our different routes.</p>

<p>They were a very fine body of men&mdash;an army of such
men, properly handled, need not fear any other soldiers on
equal terms. Had the opportunity permitted, we should
have enjoyed a visit to one of their militia camps.</p>

<p>It was very warm. Zachariah played his violin along
the road in advance; Esmeralda and Noah were very
sleepy and tired, and we were not disinclined for a halt.
For some time we could not meet with a convenient
resting-place; at last we came to a delightful valley.
There was the open macadamised space on the roadside,
with wooden bench considerately placed for the convenience
of travellers. The same accommodation might with
advantage be adopted in England. Then there was a
small space of broken greensward, sloping from the road,
where we could light our fire. A large bondegaard
below, near the River Logan, gave us the impression of
contentment and comfort. It was a charming valley.</p>

<p>As we came up to the wooden seat we observed a
curious-looking man, who the gipsies said was some
travelling “Highflyer.” The man was reclining on the
the open patch of greensward near the seat; his wallet
was beside him, and he was smoking his pipe&mdash;who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
knows? he was probably experiencing more enjoyment
than the most wealthy millionaire.</p>

<p>The donkeys were soon unloaded. Noah went down
to get some water at the farmhouse, and shortly returned
with the “vand” (Nor., water). A woman and a boy
brought up some grass for the donkeys, and she afterwards
offered us the use of some rough ground above the
road for the donkeys to graze in. The offer was accepted,
for the herbage was very scanty on the roadside. Our
water was soon boiled, and we had tea, bacon, and bread.
Taking out the packet of tobacco given up by Noah, we
gave some to the Highflyer. It is not surprising that
Noah was reluctant to part with it. Printed on the outside
of the packet we observed the following&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Petum optimum supter solem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De beste Tobac onder de Son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Der beste Toback under solen<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Af C. Andersen,<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Lillehammer.<br /></span>
</span></span></p>

<p>The Highflyer seemed much pleased. The sun was
exceedingly warm, and, placing some rugs in the scanty
shade of some rocks on the opposite side of the road,
Esmeralda fell asleep. The woman brought us some
milk, and, finding it impossible to write, we gave way to
inclination and indulged in a good sleep. Noah and
Zachariah went to the river fishing, and Zachariah
caught four not very large trout. Then we woke up and
worked at our notes.</p>

<p>A young farmer, a fine young fellow, his wife, and
son and daughter, came up. The young farmer had been
at our camp near “Storklevstad”; they brought up fresh
grass, and were very attentive. The “Hedals” rose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
above us, with snow still remaining on the higher
ridges.</p>

<p>Not so very far from this point, across the mountains,
is the “Ridderspranget” (the Knight’s Leap). Tradition
says that a knight of Valders wooed a young lady of Lom.
The friends did not favour the lovers’ wish. The knight,
at last, mounted on a swift horse, carried the lady off,
and, being closely pursued by the friends, jumped a wide
chasm, and escaped with the girl of Lom, for whom he
had risked so much. The spot, which is between two
lakes, still goes by the name of the “Ridderspranget.”</p>

<p>Esmeralda, probably owing to the heat, did not feel
well. Before we left, Noah and Zachariah played for the
people of the bondegaard, who had been so attentive,
several tunes with the violin and tambourine. The Highflyer
went towards Qvam.</p>

<p>At 3 o’clock&mdash;having presented the good woman
with a mark, and the children with three skillings each&mdash;as
they gave us their kindly wishes, we again continued
our way. Noah had added four more trout to our stock,
so that we had now eight fish for the evening’s meal.
We were all very sleepy, but kept on with much perseverance.
Zachariah, who rode on one of the donkeys,
fell asleep and his hat fell off, and then he dropped his
violin in the road, but both were picked up. After we
had passed Dengarden&mdash;so we made out the name&mdash;Noah
was so sleepy that he became a straggler; his legs
almost refused to serve him, and we at last lost sight of
him at a turn in the road.</p>

<p>A very interesting house on the roadside attracted our
attention. We understood the name was Nusamberg;
it had the appearance of an old mansion. Though constructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
of wood, its massive timbers gave it structural
solidity; extensive granaries and outbuildings surrounded
the house, and one portion of building was surmounted
by a kind of cupola with a large bell. If it had been in
England we should have taken it for an old manor
house.</p>

<p>Noah did not overtake us, and we went back, expecting
that he had fallen asleep on the roadside; at last we
saw him in the distance, walking slowly along, with difficulty
getting one leg before the other.</p>

<p>As we came in sight of “Breden,” which stands near a
lake, our party were at once perceived. A boat pushed
off in hot haste across the lake with a number of peasants
to see us. When we entered the small village of houses
grouped on either side the road, great was the excitement.
People ran hastily up to see our donkeys; a pony
in a “stolkjœrre,” or light cart, turned restive, and occasioned
much confusion. Our donkeys ran against one
another, and our things becoming entangled, the packs
were nearly pulled to the ground.</p>

<p>At last, when we were clear of the village, Noah and
Zachariah were sent to a landhandelri<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> to buy butter and
bread. The young man at the shop had been at our
camp at Qvam. They could only get fladbröd and butter.</p>

<p>The steeps of the Kringelen, memorable for the destruction
of Col. Sinclair and his soldiers, were passed. The
spot had been well selected by the Norwegians. Then
we came in sight of Sels. Having risen early, we were
all tired and hungry. At this juncture, seeing a woman
driving some cows from the road, we asked to camp on
some rough broken ground above the house. A quiet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
spot was selected, where, undisturbed by visitors, our
tents were pitched. Looking down upon the narrow
valley, it was delightful to enjoy the repose of a quiet
evening. Few were permitted to come near our tents.
Our donkeys had, as usual, their admirers, but they were
few and select. The woman brought us a bowl of milk
whilst we were at tea.</p>

<p>We were up at seven o’clock next morning. After a
quiet breakfast, Zachariah caught four trout in the river.
Giving these kind, homely people some music and two
marks, our party left Sels in the distance.</p>

<p>The scenery during the morning was very picturesque,
and coming to a portion of newly-made road we halted
in a recess of broken ground at the bottom of a wooded
hill, near a log cottage. One of our gipsies went to the
house for water, and the woman kindly offered to boil it,
but this we did not require.</p>

<p>As we were taking our lunch we became the subject of
much interest to the road men and some boys; to some of
the men we gave tobacco. After the meal our gipsies
played their music, whilst we lounged, looking at the
beautiful scene before us. The road men appeared to
enjoy themselves quite as much as we did&mdash;they sat on
the roadside, smoking their pipes and listening.</p>

<p>It was not long before we were <i>en route</i>, and being
still in sight of the river Noah and Zachariah were sent to
fish. Esmeralda and myself made the best of the way
with the donkeys towards Laurgaard. Great improvements
were being made upon this part of the road; in
some places the road was diverted and the distance
shortened&mdash;sometimes we had to change from the old
road to newly made portions, and then back to the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
road not yet altered. At every place the peasants
flocked out to see us. One place we especially remember
as being near a wild gorge leading to the mountains from
the valley. An old man gave us such a kindly hearty
welcome to his land that we presented him with some
tobacco.</p>

<p>In passing a narrow part of the old road one of our
donkeys ran against the Puru Rawnee, and the baggage
becoming entangled my tent pole was broken through.
It was very annoying. At last we came in sight of the
Laurgaard. A peasant who had walked with us some
little distance, and who seemed desirous to aid us as
much as possible, was asked if we could find a camping-ground
on the other side Laurgaard. He shook his head.</p>

<p>We had just passed some picturesque rocks; the river
Logan was on our left, the rocky slopes of the mountain
on our right. Our peasant pointed to what appeared to
have been an old road, now disused, a short distance
above us along the hill side. The old roadway formed
an admirable terrace of flat ground for our tents. Our
donkeys soon struggled through the bushes and broken
rocks to the spot we selected, and were then unloaded.
Several peasants appeared at the place, and also a Norwegian
officer. Our first care, as the gipsies unloaded our
things, was to splice our tent pole, which we did with a
flat piece of wood we had found <i>en route</i>, and some
waxed string carried with us. Our proceedings were observed
with great interest as we pitched our tents. The
visitors increased, and we promised to give them some
music for dancing after we had finished our tea. Immediately
after tea, as the peasants assembled at close of
eve, our guitar, violin, tambourine, and castinets broke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
the stillness of the Norwegian valley. On this occasion
we had two beaux of the village instead of one. The old
road being level was well adapted for dancing. There
were several peasant girls, whose quiet and modest
manners were very pleasing. One beau was a light
haired young man who borrowed a friend’s shoes to dance
in. The other beau was a slim-slam, away-with-care
sort of young fellow, who had the appearance of “un vrai
chasseur,” an intrepid reindeer hunter. He was a good-looking
fellow, carried hard sinew and muscle, well-proportioned,
moderately tall and strongly knit, wiry and
active, wore very large capacious trousers, and strong
Wellington boots. A hunting knife hung by his side,
and a close-fitting shirt and small cap lightly stuck on his
head completed his attire. He held himself very erect,
and danced in a stiff, jerky, jaunty style. We had the
usual complement of children, in many and various kinds
of tattered garments. The peasants seemed to enjoy
themselves. Esmeralda danced with her brother, and
we also took her for partner; but the half-hour is ended,
our visitors leave as the rain commences. We had
very heavy rain in the night.</p>

<p>Ourself and the gipsies were up at 4 o’clock, and
went fishing. The river Logan near our camp was interspersed
with pools and shallows, and appeared very
likely in appearance for fish. The bridge at Laurgaard
is said to be 1000 English feet above the level of the
sea. We must confess that Noah and ourself returned
without fish to breakfast. Directly the meal was concluded
Noah and Zachariah were dispatched to the river
again. A fine-looking old man came to see our tent
after breakfast. He wore a red cap, and said he was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
great fisherman. We found him full of information.
His sæter was on the Rudane Fjeld, where he said there
were many reindeer; in summer the weather was beautiful.
The old man came often during the day, and we
bought some trout from him, and also from several
peasant boys, who immediately they caught a fish
brought it up to our tents.</p>

<p>In the read below we noticed a curious dark little
woman accompanied by a middle-aged man, a tall young
woman without shoes or stockings, and two young boys.
They carried their effects apparently for sleeping and cooking.
Directly they saw the donkeys they came towards
our camp. The boys tried to touch our donkeys, but
the young woman held them back, and one was smartly
cuffed. When the elder woman reached our tents we
at first thought she was a gipsy. Her complexion was very
dark, and she had black hair; she had pleasing manners,
but in person she was very short, with small hands
and feet, and a peculiar redness round the eyes, as if from
smoke. Esmeralda tried her in Romany, but she could
not speak it. She was very probably a Lap. The others
of her party seemed to hold her in great respect. She
carried a courier bag suspended to a girdle, exactly similar
to the one we bought in the Valders, and of which an engraving
is given in this book. We gave her some
brandy and the man some tobacco, upon which she
opened her bag, and in the politest manner possible,
offered us two skillings, which we did not accept. Every
now and then as she looked at our tents and then at the
donkeys grazing near, she smiled and bowed in an ecstasy
of pleasure, raising her hands often, saying “<i>Nei, nei!!</i>” in
a sweet plaintive voice. Esmeralda asked if she told fortunes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and she said yes. It is probable that she did not
understand the question. She offered to sell Esmeralda
a ring, but she did not require it. As they left they
lingered again near the donkeys. The old lady seemed
in raptures with them. One of the boys again made a
sudden attempt to touch one, and was dragged away by
the younger woman as if his life was in jeopardy.</p>

<p>They at length left and slowly disappeared through the
rocks at a turn in the road beyond the camp. Noah
and Zachariah caught several fish during the morning.
The fish were fried for dinner with the usual accompaniment
of tea. We scarcely knew whether we dined
early or late, both meals were so much the same. From
time to time travellers passing along the road suddenly
pulled up when they saw our tents and donkeys, and
getting down slowly made their way up to our camp.
The donkeys seemed, as usual, to excite a wonderful
amount of interest.</p>

<p>We had finished our mid-day’s meal. Noah and
Zachariah had gone to the river to fish. Esmeralda and
myself were sitting in our tents; the gipsy girl was
occasionally rockering Romany whilst we wrote our
notes. Then the thought occurred to her that we should
tell her fortune.</p>

<p>“Your fortune must be a good one,” said we, laughing.</p>

<p>“Let me see your hand, young woman, and your lines
of life.”</p>

<p>We shall never forget Esmeralda. She looked so
earnestly as we regarded attentively the lines of her open
hand. Then we took her step by step through some
scenes of her supposed future. We did not tell all. The
rest was reserved for another day. There was a serious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
look on her countenance as we ended, but reader, such
secrets should not be revealed&mdash;say what we will the
hand carries the same language as those thoughtful lines
on your face, or the conformation of your head. It is not
all who can interpret them. Though we do not believe
in chiromancy and ghosts, how many in the world do.
We do not say such things are impossible; there are
warnings, forebodings, and presentiments at times too
strong to be doubted. There are curious facts noted
which cast singular light upon these links between two
worlds. Instances of spirit travel are given. The open
pages of nature reveal strange things. Pliny, Scott,
Byron, Johnson, Wesley, and Baxter<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, seem to have been
imbued with some belief in the supernatural. We know
not what it is; we call it superstition. When we express
our unbelief, somehow there is often an inward consciousness
to belie our words. Surrounded by much that is
false, there may be some reality. We halt on the threshold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
of indecision. One thing is certain, there is a dark
mysterious veil across man’s future in this world. Will
it profit him to raise its folds? We think not.</p>

<p>Esmeralda commenced to tell our fortune; we were
interested to know what she would say. We cast ourself
on the waves of fate. The gipsy girl raised her dark
eyes from our hand as she looked us earnestly in the face.</p>

<p>“You are a young gentleman of good connections;
many lands you have seen; but, young man, something
tells me you be of a wavering disposition.”</p>

<p>We looked up, and a Norwegian peasant stood close
by; we had not heard him approach. He was at the
entrance of our tents in puzzled contemplation; we lost
the remainder of our fortune.</p>

<p>Not very long afterwards, we were sitting in our tent,
when Esmeralda, who was looking out, said, a “Boro
Rye’s a vellin.” We went out; an English officer was
coming to our tents; he was travelling from Throndjhem
to Christiania. His name was one of a family renowned
in Scottish history. Our visitor was very good-looking,
and seemed much interested in our camp. Seeing our
tents from the read, he came up to inspect them; a
heavy shower of rain coming on, he accepted our shelter,
and reclined in our tent with Esmeralda and ourselves.
The carriole driver sat at the entrance. Our visitor
informed us that a friend and himself had been out with
a pony, tent and provisions, upon a fishing expedition,
on the Tana. It did not appear that he remained long
with his tent, for we understood him that his friend had
been unwell and they soon returned. The country of
the Tana seemed to please him very much. We gave
our visitor some results of our practical experience in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
camping, as he sat waiting for the rain to cease; in
truth, he seemed in no hurry to continue his journey.
One of our gipsy songs was presented to him as a
souvenir of his visit; then we purchased some trout
from the Skydskarl, for one mark, eighteen skillings, very
fine ones they were, and had been caught in a lake.
Esmeralda presented the captain with a “pinthorn,”
used to fasten the blankets of our tents. This present,
which he told Esmeralda he should keep, was placed
carefully in his pocket-case. In making the expedition
to the Tana he had taken out a tent from Throndjhem
with a pole in the middle and pieces stretching out from
centre.</p>

<p>Our gipsy tents were carefully inspected, then our
waterproofs, pockets, bags, and other things. The
method of pitching our tents was explained. Before he
went he gave us a bottle of brandy which he did not
want, and promised to inquire if anything had been heard
of our lost caps. His driver, we thought, was under the
impression that the captain would take up his residence
with us. Noah came up as our visitor was leaving.
The rain cleared off, and, wishing us good-by, he was
soon driving rapidly towards Christiania. Our visitors
continued, successively, until tea time. For our tea, we
had more fried trout. An old man brought us a quantity
of fladbröd and butter, for which we paid tenpence.
Wire was procured at Laurgaard to suspend our boiling-can
and kettle over the fire. The loss of our kettle-prop
put us to much inconvenience. At eight o’clock, the
peasants, notwithstanding the rain, came to our camp for
dancing; fortunately, the rain ceased, and they seemed
to enjoy themselves very much. One tall, powerful,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
middle-aged peasant, who came with our visitors, was
very fond of dancing. He was, apparently, the respectable
owner of a gaard in the neighbourhood. Though
very anxious for Esmeralda to dance with him, she would
only dance with ourself or Noah. Then he asked us to
dance with one of the young peasant girls, probably, a
daughter, or some relation, which we did. She was the
best dancer; a very good type of the Norwegian peasant-girl,
tall, quiet, modest, and good-looking; we found her
an excellent partner. Our beaux of the village kept up
the dancing and the gipsies their music. “Lend me
your shoes” must have put his friend to some expense
for repairs, and “Slim-slam,” the reindeer-hunter, nobly
did his duty. We were almost bewildered at times. It
was hard work to control the exuberant spirits of our
gipsies. The amount of Romany chaff was something
extraordinary. Fortunately, our visitors did not understand
it, nor do we think the gipsies understood much of it
themselves. Their gaiety knew no bounds. Esmeralda
once laughed loud enough to frighten the reindeer from
the Rudane Fjeld. She had more than one severe doing,
as she called it, during the evening.

<p>More than once we were half-inclined to tie a loose
piece of rock to our gipsies’ necks and throw them into
the Logan; still, we had promised to bring them back,
dead or alive, to their parents. Gipsies, whatever their
faults may be, have boundless affection for their offspring,
perhaps too much so. A promise is a promise; we kept
ours. Our music ceased in the valley of Laurgaard, and
we wished our visitors all good-by. Many lingered by
the donkeys as we retired to our tent, and watched the
picturesque valley before us. The delightful stillness
seemed to give to our musings a charm and novelty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
only experienced in tent life. Then we heard the sound
of merry voices in the road below; a children’s game;
the peasant boys united to keep the girls from coming
up the bank to the road. Sometimes there were sharp
and vigorous contests, and the girls, for a time, had
almost taken the road by storm. Here and there we
saw single-handed encounters; then several girls, who
had maintained the struggle, would be pushed down, and
rolled over the bank pell-mell on one another. Now
and then boys would be dragged from the road and
swung in a heap on the green sward. To whom the
victory, we know not; exposure to the open air predisposes
to sleep. What a deep and refreshing sleep
was ours when all was still. In the early morning,
within view of Laurgaard and its bridge, the tents of the
wanderers, with three donkeys browsing near, might be
seen on the hill side.</p>

<p>We were late the next day, for we did not rise before
seven o’clock. At eight o’clock, we had a good breakfast
of trout; they were excellent. The old fisherman with
red cap came to see us again, and gave us some reindeer
flesh; we made him a present of some fishing-flies.</p>

<p>Striking camp, with a hearty farewell to those peasants
who came as we were leaving, we were again <i>en route</i>.
Esmeralda, Noah, and Zachariah were full of spirits, as
we entered the beautiful wild gorge beyond Laurgaard.
A man from a sæter in the mountains followed us for
some short distance, and we saw him afterwards sitting
on an eminence, watching us as we toiled up the steep
ascent of the romantic glen.</p>

<p>At Romungaard, near Laurgaard, Colonel Sinclair
stayed the night previous to his death at the Kringelen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
The road also branches off from Laurgaard to Vaage.
On either side the mountain slopes were thickly wooded
with Scotch fir, interspersed with birch. We had a long
ascent from Laurgaard, but the scenery amply repaid
us for our toil.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The river foamed in the rocks below,
and at one place Zachariah tried his fly, but without
success. The Haalangen Fjeld, and the Rusten Fjeld
bounded our route on either side. We met several
carrioles, and some peasants followed us. At last, we
came to a small wood of alder bushes, open to the road.
On the opposite side the valley we noticed a very large
house. The donkeys were no sooner unloaded, than a
tall young man and several peasants came to us.
It is not pleasant to have visitors pressing round when
you are preparing for your bivouac meal. Explaining
that if they would leave us for half-an-hour we would
give them some music they at once left. Our mid-day’s
meal, consisting of fish, was scarcely finished when
our visitors returned. The tall young man was a very
intelligent fellow. The peasant who had introduced us
to our partner the evening before was there. We sang
our gipsy song with the guitar; Zachariah and Noah
played for them; and one of our visitors also played
some Norwegian airs. The order was at length given
to load; Noah did so, with a considerable amount of
chaff with his brother and sister. All being ready, we
bade our visitors adieu, who seemed disappointed we
were not going to camp there for the night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>The valley now became more open, and we began
to descend towards “Dovre.” The usual number of
peasants came at various points on the road to see us;
sometimes Zachariah played his violin, sometimes Esmeralda
sang. One song was an Irish song; it is a
curious specimen of song lore. Esmeralda would sometimes
dance as she sang the words of the song; we have
never met with it before, and therefore give the words.
The song and the dance, and air, by the gipsy girl,
with all the accessories of pine forest, rising mountains,
and a wilderness of interesting scenery, was very
effective.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We passed “Brœndhaugen,” having the Jetta Fjeld
on our left and St. Kaven and Vesle Fjeld on our right.
Two very civil peasants at length joined our party. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
clouds seemed very wild and dark over the mountains of
the Dovre Fjeld. At length we crossed a bridge near
Dovre. The loose blocks of water-washed stones on
our road towards the bridge added to the wildness of
the evening scene. After some failures, we made the
men understand that we wanted to find a shop to buy
bread. When we had passed the bridge a lame boy
came to solicit alms, and we gave him two shillings.
As we approached the village of Dovre a close carriage
drove up, and the donkeys were halted for it to pass.
The traveller also pulled up and began leisurely to
inspect the donkeys through the carriage window.
Our time was pressing. Noah was indignant that we
should be expected to wait to satisfy the curiosity of
every traveller. If they had been ladies the case
might have been different, but now our party moved on
without delay.</p>

<p>The road we had followed during the day was at
one time as high as 1800 feet above the level of the
sea. Now we had descended to about 1500 feet. A
gentleman drove past in his four-wheeled carriage,
having apparently some of his family with him. Stopping
his carriage, he seemed much interested with our party.
Some hay was given to the donkeys from the stock he
had for his own use. There was something so friendly
in his manner, that if he had wished to gaze on the
donkeys all night they would probably have remained
where they were. Comfortable houses were scattered
here and there, and we noticed posts and rails set up in
the fields, which seemed to us to have no sort of use as
fences. At first we thought they must be somehow
connected with the winter’s snows, as drift barriers, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
we afterwards found that the grass when cut is placed
on them to dry, and in many places we observed the
same method of making hay.</p>

<p>The village landhandelri, or shop, stood near the
church. Noah was sent with money to buy bread, whilst
we went down a short steep descent of the road beyond
the churchyard and halted. In a very short time a number
of boys and children collected around us; a dog began to
bark at the donkeys, and a man immediately hit the dog
and took him away. We afterwards gave the man some
tobacco. We could not help remarking the kind and
orderly conduct of the peasant children.</p>

<p>The church, of wood, is roofed with large slates surmounted
by a steeple painted green. Though not in
accordance with our idea of architectural taste, it was
immeasurably superior to the green pagoda we once saw
on the top of the old church of Guérande, in Brittany.
Noah was very successful, and bought nineteen loves of
bread for three marks nine skillings. As we left Dovre,
Zachariah was sent back for eggs, and he joined us soon
after with twenty-one eggs in a handkerchief, for which
he had given one mark nineteen skillings.</p>

<p>Our way continued along a very pleasant road to
Toftemoen. A number of peasant boys followed us, who
were, no doubt, anxious to see us camp. The station of
Toftemoen stands from the road, with a large open space
before it. A great number of Norwegian ponies were
loose near the station. The house seems very comfortable,
with ample accommodation. It is the residence of
Herr Tofte, a descendant of Harold Haarfager (the Fair-haired).
Harold Haarfager died in 933, and was succeeded
by his son, Hako the Good, so that Herr Tofte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
has a splendid and royal ancestry. It is stated they
never marry out of their own family.</p>

<p>In Mr. Bennett’s hand-book it is noted that the king
dined here on his way to be crowned at Throndjhem,
in 1860, and Herr Tofte had sufficient silver plate for
the use of his Majesty and all his retinue.</p>

<p>A traveller accosted us near the station, who was probably
one of the passengers of the close carriage we had
seen near Dovre. He seemed anxious to know how far
we were going. No time was to be lost, for it was eight
o’clock. We passed along the sandy road by a piece of
rough broken ground, and then all the peasant boys
left us when they found we did not camp there. At
last, descending a short declivity of the road, we came
to some open greensward lying between the road and
the river. A narrow patch of turf with a stream running
through it. On the opposite side the road a thick wood,
inclosed by a fence, made an admirable shelter; a quiet
retired place between two hillocks. As we came to the
flat we saw the trace of fires, and at once unloaded and
pitched our tents as far from the roadside as possible,
and very near to the low river bank. It was a romantic
camp-ground.</p>

<p>The view was beautiful&mdash;a rocky island in the river
formed the foreground, and beyond we gazed upon the
mountains of the Dovre Fjeld. The day’s toil was soon
forgotten as the fire burnt brightly and night cast its
dark shadows on our lonely camp. Our eggs were
broken one by one into a bowl. If stale, they were consigned
to the river; if fresh, to the frying-pan. About
seventeen out of twenty-one remained for the omelette,
which with bread formed our evening’s meal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>A jolly, pleasant old man came up whilst we were
camping, and taking a dram of brandy bowed and retired.
Then the donkeys strayed and a tall peasant came and
helped Zachariah to search for them. The donkeys were
found up a lane, at some distance from our camp, and
Zachariah asked the man to ride one of them back, but
the peasant shrunk from it with alarm, and said something
which probably meant, “Not if I know it.”
Zachariah mounted on one of the donkeys, drove the
other two before him at racing speed, whilst the peasant
followed almost dead with laughter. Zachariah informed
us some carriers were halted for the night on the road-side,
at a short distance from our camp. The name of
the place, as far as we could make out, was Losere.
We were left undisturbed, and in the quiet enjoyment
of our camp fire, till we retired to rest.</p>

<p>On the top of the short road ascent, near our
camp, a large gate led from the road towards a
house above. Some traffic seemed to be going on
towards this place. About four o’clock in the morning
we heard a heavy tramp of horses’ feet, apparently close
to our tent. Then there was the sound of a man’s
voice&mdash;pūr-r-r-r! pūr-r-r-r. It was evident that the
animal fought shy of our tent or the donkeys. We
called to Noah, but beyond a heavy snort or two we
had no response. We went out twice; the second time
we saw a man with a pony going up the opposite
ascent. His pony still fought very shy of one of the
donkeys grazing near the road. About seven o’clock,
when we were getting ready for breakfast, we saw a boy
driving a load of wood towards the gate. The pony
just as he came to the gate, seeing our tent below,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
turned suddenly round. We struck our tent, and going
up found the boy with the wood fastened on a low, light
Norwegian wood-carriage, overturned in a ditch. With
Noah’s assistance the pony, timber, and carriage passed
without difficulty through the gate, and we gave the
boy four skillings, which seemed to astonish him.</p>

<p>In Norway we particularly noticed the temperate
manner with which drivers manage their horses. All is
patient kindness. The animals are in consequence docile
to a degree. Beyond the quiet pūr-r-r-r, and a shake of
the reins, nothing is heard; no coarse expletives, no
brutality of treatment, such as we have occasionally
witnessed in our own country, unworthy the Christian
and the man. In England, necessity founded a society,
and passed a stringent Act of Parliament, for the protection
of dumb animals, &amp;c., but in Norway it is
unnecessary.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>A few peasants came up as we were loading our donkeys,
and the gipsies gave them some music before we
continued our journey. The soil now became very sandy,
and the ground below the road jutted out into large promontories
towards the river’s bank.</p>

<p>We were joined by a travelling shoemaker and his
companion, who evinced much curiosity about the boots
worn by our party. The route now ascended far above
the river Logan, and the view became very wild. In
some Scotch firs Noah and Zachariah and the shoemaker
saw a squirrel, which had a narrow chance for its life;
but to our satisfaction escaped. The wild flowers were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
beautiful. Esmeralda plucked them as we went along,
and, as usual, presented the Rye with a handsome bouquet.
The shoemaker and his friend left us at some
bondegaard, and we soon after reached <i>Dombaas</i>. This is
apparently named as <i>Lie</i> station in an early edition of
Murray. The Dombaas Post Station is a short distance
from the junction of the Romsdal and Throndjhem routes.
The road to Romsdalen branches off to the left, and
that to <i>Throndjhem</i> to the right. Dombaas appears to be
an excellent station. We, of course, cannot give our
actual experience; but we have no doubt most excellent
accommodation would be found there. We halted in some
open ground of the extensive forest on the opposite side
the road to the station. What a ravishing scene met our
view, as we sat down on the mossy turf, whilst the gipsies
made preparations for dinner. What a wilderness of pine
forest! On our right, the road we had just turned from
continued over the Dovre Fjeld to Throndjhem. Not far
from us, on the left of the road to Thronjhem, is the
Snehœtten Fjeld, 7714 English feet above the level of
the sea. The ascent to this mountain is gradual, and its
peaked summit is only 3500 feet. Some few people
came to see our donkeys; but they did not disturb us
whilst we were preparing and taking our mid-day’s meal.
Our meal consisted of fried bacon, one fish Zacharia had
caught, and bread and tea. A very intelligent, pleasant
young Norwegian came to us afterwards and spoke
English. It is possible that he was the son of the owner
of the station. He told us where there was good pasture
for the donkeys; but we were going on, and did not
intend to camp for the night. Yet we left with regret,
for it was a beautiful ground for our tents. Large forests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
extended on various sides, with excellent pasture. A
young ragged boy, to whom we gave some tobacco and
brandy, came and conversed, whilst one, who was probably
the owner of the station, stood in the road above,
smoking his pipe as he contemplated our party. Whilst
we wrote our notes, Noah loaded the donkeys, and he
chaffed his brother and sister in a jumble of English,
Romany, and a few Norwegian words he had now learnt.
Two or three respectably dressed, quiet, well-fed men,
who had come to see us, were probably connected with
the station. The gipsies played a few tunes, and then
we passed through the forest across two wild, brawling,
rapid streams; and, ascending the steep road on the side
of a picturesque valley, we came to some houses. We
were at once followed by several boys; one of whom was
very intelligent and spoke some English. Zachariah was
mounted on the packs of one of the loaded donkeys. The
boys evidently expected us to camp; but at last, after
walking some distance, gave up in despair. The road
now crossed the side of a mountain, with no inclosures.
Below us lay the valley and the river. Finding we should
shortly come to more houses and inclosures, we at once
decided to camp without delay at the foot of a rocky
slope covered with low scrub and bushes. As we were
just unloading our donkeys, a man came in sight with an
axe in one hand and a piece of wood in the other. The
sight of our party soon stopped his progress. He looked
as if he thought we were fairies or some such visitants to
earth. The axe reminded us that our tent pole was now
so broken as to be almost useless. We beckoned him in
vain. The peasant had evidently resolved not to venture
nearer. Noah and ourself, taking the broken tent pole,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
went to him and gave him a dram of brandy to screw up
his courage. The peasant soon saw what we wanted,
and taking the broken pole as a pattern, went off to make
a new one.</p>

<p>As the gipsies lighted our fire, they noticed in the
valley far below us, at the base of the mountains, a
curling smoke, which they thought in the indistinctness
of the evening to be a “gipsies’ camp.” Very anxious
indeed were we to meet with a camp of Norwegian gipsies.
Ever on the look-out&mdash;as yet we had been unable to
meet with any Romany tents&mdash;the meeting of English
gipsies with Norwegian zigeuner, and their greeting in
Romany, would have been a most interesting study. The
route we were travelling was evidently too much populated
and frequented for these wanderers. Prœsten Sundt
indeed says, “They choose the most devious and least-frequented
roads or ways between Stavanger and Aggerhuus,
and northwards away to Throndjhem and Finmarken.”
Still there was the chance, and we hoped as
we travelled northwards we should be fortunate enough to
meet some gipsy tribe of dusky wanderers with their
tents, horses, trappings, pigs, and baggage. In this
instance, after watching for some short time with earnest
attention, it was decided by our gipsies that the smoke
did not issue from the camp of any of their people.

<p>The old man presently brought a new tent pole, for
which we paid sixteen skillings. We had left Dombaas
about half-past 5 o’clock. Our present camp was called
by the people, “Losere.” A few peasants came to our
tents, and we must say presented a starved and worn
appearance. They were a kind people, and brought us
firewood. We had bread, butter, cold bacon, and tea.
The peasants were told they could have some music
when our meal was ended. How we enjoyed the evening
scene when the peasants approached our fire! and we
invited them, as usual, in our well got-up phrase in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
Norwegian, “Ver so artig tage en stole” (Be so good as
to take a seat), pointing to the turf, which was the only
seat we could offer them. The moon rose upon the summits
and ranges of distant mountains beyond the valley.
Its pale rays gleamed in the still night on the waters of
the Logan. Nature was lovely in all her beauty. As
our bivouac fire glimmered on the peasants’ hard-worn
countenances, furrowed with lines of hardship, we could
observe the pleasure which our music gave them. Wild
though it was, it seemed to suit time, place, and circumstance.
The violin, tambourine, castanets, and guitar are
admirably adapted for the minstrelsy of the wanderer’s
life. As our music ended they left, and we retired to
our tents. The ground was high; the night was cold;
we had little shelter; but we were now habituated to
camp life, and did not feel any inconvenience. Our sleep
was ever deep and refreshing. If any of our party had
been asked, “What is indigestion?” we could not have
given them any decisive answer.</p>

<p>The morning was fine and beautiful, as we rose at 7
o’clock. From the mountain where we had camped we
could see Holiaker. Our breakfast consisted of tea, and
bread and butter; at Dombaas we had given our gipsies
citric acid and water; it is a substitute for vegetables,
which we had not been able to procure since we left the
<i>Mjösen</i> Lake. Zachariah had refused to take any citric
acid until he reached Dombaas; whether it was from want
of vegetables we could not tell, but what with musketos,
insects of various kinds, and possibly the want of vegetables,
his skin was irritable to an uncomfortable degree,
especially at night. This irritation of the skin we have
known before in camp life. A friend of ours tenting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
with us the year before, had suffered very much from
similar irritation of the skin not the result of musketo
bites; sometimes we thought it was nettlerash, but in two
or three days after our friend had quitted the tents the
irritation had disappeared. In Zachariah’s case the gipsies
and ourself thought he had been bitten by creas (gip.
ants) or that musketos might have occasioned it; then it
was assigned to want of vegetables or impurity of the blood.
Should any one of our readers be able to suggest the
cause and remedy we should be much obliged for their
communication. In this case, as the Cushty Drabengro of
the party, we prescribed citric acid, which we carried in
crystals, and dissolved in water. One peasant brought a
large basket of hay for the donkeys, for which we paid a
mark. The basket conveniently fitted on the back like a
knapsack. Before we left our camp, we thought it
might be well to buy a sheep, for we had not purchased
any meat since we left Christiania, and it might be
prudent to save our commissariat.</p>

<p>We explained to the peasants by aid of our dictionary,
and they seemed to understand our wishes, but whether
they were afterwards unable to procure the sheep, or
did not distinctly comprehend, is doubtful, for our negotiations
were without result. Zachariah and Esmeralda
played a few airs for the peasants whilst Noah loaded
the donkeys.</p>

<p>Soon after we left our camp the route lay between
enclosures. No lack of excitement on all sides; at one
house a stout good-tempered woman and a dark good-humoured
seafaring-looking man, probably her husband,
came out.</p>

<p>Finding we wished to purchase something to eat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
he went with us along the road to the Holiaker
station.</p>

<p>Whether he was the master, or a friend of the house
we could not decide. In the large clean kitchen he
conversed with a tall, respectable, delicate-looking woman.
At first she began to make coffee for us; then we
explained through the seafaring man we did not want
coffee, but bread, butter, and eggs; then she commenced
to boil the water for the eggs. At last we made her
understand that what we purchased the gipsies would
take with them.</p>

<p>The donkeys were brought down to the station door, and
we bought a quantity of fladbröd, twelve eggs, some
potatoes, 5½ lbs. of what appeared to be the shoulder of
very dry wasted-looking mutton, and some salt. It was
proposed to have some treacle, but we could not find the
Norwegian word in the dictionary.</p>

<p>As we put the different things we bought down in our
note book, our seafaring-looking friend priced them;
an old man came in whilst we were there, and our gipsies
took the things to the donkeys. Whether we misunderstood
the weight of the mutton, we cannot tell, but we
gave him eight marks five skillings, though we thought the
price rather high. Upon counting it, they honestly said
we had made a mistake, and returned three marks; they
also, we found, gave us the salt and six eggs into our
bargain; many lands we have travelled, but never have
we met with a more honest race of people than the
Norwegians. Our things being packed away by the
gipsies, we shook hands with these <i>honnêtes gens</i>.</p>

<p>The idea occurred to us that they took us for a wandering
artist. Farewell, honest people! For some time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
they watched us from the house, as we went along the
road towards Holiaker church.</p>

<p>On our left we saw the Lake by Lœsje, and at last
came to a shallow stream in a large forest of Scotch
firs open to the road. The soil was light and sandy;
large masses of moss-covered rocks were scattered
through the forest, and here and there we saw open
glades amongst the trees. To a spot pleasantly
secluded from the road the donkeys were driven. The
day being Saturday, we expected our Sunday would be
spent as a day of quiet and repose, but it was an illusory
hope. The ground was covered by a kind of heath
with foliage like our boxtree. We had no sooner
unpacked, than the gipsies looked round and two gorgios
were announced. It did not matter how secluded the
spot, in less than two minutes one or two Norwegian
peasants seemed to rise out of the ground; indeed if they
had been smaller, and had not chewed tobacco, we should
have taken them for fairies; two peasants were now
gazing at our party.</p>

<p>The plaid bag was called for, and they quaffed brandy
to Gamle Norge and filled their pipes with tobacco. One
said something about a better place, but we were content
to rest where we were now that we had unloaded.</p>

<p>The stream flowing to the Lake on the other side the
road was conveniently near. A slice of fried ham and an
egg each was consumed, and Noah and Zachariah were
sent to the Lake to fish. When they returned at eight
o’clock, Esmeralda had the tea ready; they had caught
five trout, which were soon in our <i>tetteramengry</i> (gip.
frying-pan) with four eggs. The news had spread. The
peasants came in numbers; whilst Esmeralda was frying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
our fish our visitors earnestly chewed and spit in all
directions about our fire; some went to the donkeys,
some inspected our things, the rest closed in upon
Esmeralda, who could scarcely complete her cooking.</p>

<p>We could see indications of a white squall on the
usually smiling countenance of our gipsy <i>Hobbenengree</i>;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
sometimes she shoved them right and left, and said
something about gorgios getting in her road.</p>

<p>“Now then!” said Esmeralda in a <i>fume</i>, “chiv the
Metteramengery, just dik the gorgios all round. I can’t
think what they all want to see.” It was very excusable,
our peasant friends had never seen our donkeys, or tents,
or gipsies before, still if they would have left us quietly
whilst we were at tea we should have much preferred it.
When we were seated near the fire, the peasant men,
women, and children closed round us; it was difficult to
decide, as we watched their countenances, whether they
thought our meal well or indifferently cooked; it might
not have been up to a dinner produced at Les Trois Frères,
(we hope the Communists have spared it). Nor had we
champagne frappé, but under the circumstances we found
our tea from Phillips’s, King William Street, a very good
substitute. Esmeralda was an excellent <i>cuisinière</i>,
especially when the gorgios gave her sufficient elbow
room; nor had we any means of ascertaining their ideas
as to the luxury of the diet. This with some other
matters must remain one of the unsolved mysteries of
this book. The intense and solemn earnestness with
which our visitors watched every scrap we ate was
interrupted by a peasant woman’s child, who was taken
with a cascade fit, and very near made an important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
addition to Zachariah’s pannikin of tea. This closed
rather abruptly our soirée. Noah went to pitch the tents,
Esmeralda put up the tea things, and though rather
reluctant, as she said, to play for the gorgios, at our
request accompanied Zachariah on the tambourine. Our
visitors seemed much pleased; Zachariah was irrepressible
with Romany chaff, although I had cautioned him
to be careful when we had visitors. The music ended,
eleven o’clock came, no signs of any one leaving; what
with Esmeralda shouting from the inside our tents at
those who touched the outside, and Noah and Zachariah
tumbling with wild merriment, we were <i>au désespoir</i>,
until taking hold of Zachariah, we threw him, after a
brief tussle, into the tent, and caught him such a box
that he was effectually silenced. There was a gipsy
collapse. We informed the visitors we wanted to go to
bed, and they quietly left, except some few who still
clung to the donkeys at some distance away.</p>

<p>We began to think we should end our days as a showman,
or the respectable manager of a strolling company
of players. It was a beautiful moonlight night, as we
strolled forth for a few minutes before retiring to rest.
Just going to sleep, we heard Zachariah’s voice, in melancholy
and watery tone: “Mr. Smith’s tired of me,”
whimpered he; “next time he’ll try and do without me;
some people change. Mr. Smith’s changed; I hope he’ll
get another as will do as well.” We seized the opportunity
to explain his real position, and his proper line of
conduct; the gipsies had received much kindness from
us, we shared with them our provisions whatever we
had. Somehow gipsies, donkeys, tents, and accessories
seemed to have become part and parcel of our existence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
They gave us a dreamy happiness, as we floated along by
mountain, river, lake, and forest. The gipsies’ wild
energy never flagged; we could pull through any difficulty;
wet and fine, storm and sunshine, still our tents found a
resting-place in the wild scenes of a beautiful and hospitable
land. The gipsies saw the force of our observations,
and with “cushty raty” to all, we were soon in a
sound sleep.</p>

<p>We did not get up very early; it was nearly nine
o’clock; Esmeralda had a slight cold. The morning was
very fine, and the last three or four days had been very
warm. Noah went out, and found the peasants had
already collected, and were increasing in numbers. Noah
made tea, fried two excellent trout with four eggs, which,
with bread and fladbröd and butter, formed our frokost.</p>

<p>The visitors were so numerous that we had breakfast
in our tent. Whilst at breakfast a peasant would occasionally
try to look at us through the opening we were
obliged to have for ventilation. We were at last obliged
to speak rather sharp to those pressing against our tent,
and they were more careful; we had very little fault to
find. We do not believe they would ever give intentional
annoyance; in fact, the kindness we received on
all occasions throughout our wanderings will ever be
remembered.</p>

<p>As the sun rose our tents became very warm; we
strolled out, dressed in our light blue flannel jacket,
white waistcoat, light trousers, long Napoleon riding
boots, and straw hat, which was the only one we possessed.
It was a deliciously warm morning; on the
opposite side of the lake we could see the Kjölen Fjeldene
rising above it. Our camp was in a large forest, extending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
towards the Stor Horungen. The Jora Elv, which
we had crossed near Dombaas, flows between the Stor
Horungen and Hundsjö Fjeldet; then on its left banks
are the mountains called “Sjung Hö” and the
“Tvœraatind,” and on the right the “Mjugsjö Hö,”
“Skreda Hö,” and beyond are the wilds of the
“Snehœtten”. The Jora Elv falls into the Logan near
Dombaas. This extensive tract of mountain, forest, lake,
and river is as yet, we believe, little known to anglers.</p>

<p>We bought twelve eggs from a peasant woman for
twelve skillings; a boy brought six trout, which we also
bought for twelve skillings. We confess to feelings of
melancholy that, with three fly-rods and an immense
stock of flies, in a country like Norway, we should so far
lower our dignity as a sportsman as to buy trout. Still
four hungry people to be fed much influenced the purchase.
We hoped for better things, which might remove
this passing shadow from the annals of our angler’s life.</p>

<p>It occurred to us to go to church, but there was the
uncertainty as to the time the services commenced, and
whether there would be any service on that particular
Sunday. In some districts service is only held on occasional
Sundays, as we remember to have been the case in
some parishes in Wales. The country churches are built
of wood; we only met with one exception. No church
bells in the valley sounded over the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>A large number of peasants congregated round us as
we sat down on a rock; wherever we moved there they
came. As we lounged about near our tents, and looked
round at the peasants of all sizes and ages, females with
children in their arms, young girls and ragged boys
wandering after us through the rocky mazes of the broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
ground, like a comet’s tail, but not quite so luminous, we
resigned ourselves to our fate. The peasants seemed as
interested as usual, and we conversed as well as we could
with them. They are a friendly, kind people. One boy
spoke English very fairly, though he had never been in
England; there was an intelligence about him which
pleased us. Several questions were propounded, one
was whether we had grapes in England&mdash;if we had
much fruit&mdash;whether we could fish free&mdash;what kind of
winter we had in England&mdash;if we had been in France
and Germany? The boy was much astonished when we
told him we had not only been to France and Germany,
but all round the world. The boy was told, if he would
come to our camp in the evening, he should have an
English book as a present.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding frequent solicitations that we would
give them some music, we remained firm, and gave
our reasons. They asked if we had any objection
to a peasant playing. They were told to please themselves,
so that it was not close to our tents. The
peasant had a large, powerful, fine-toned accordion, and,
if it had not been Sunday, we should have managed a
pleasant concert.</p>

<p>Noah and Zachariah had leave of absence till three
o’clock; they returned at half-past two o’clock. Having
crossed the lake in a boat, they had been for a ramble on
the “Kjölen Fjeldene.” A peasant boy had offered them
the use of the boat if we stayed a day longer. Our
dinner consisted of six fish and five eggs, fried in oil,
with black bread and tea. Though our visitors were then
reduced to about twenty-five persons, at three o’clock
there were again fresh arrivals; one peasant woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
brought the donkeys fresh grass. They hurried up in
parties, perspiring in the warm sun, inquiring for “den
asen.” Then they hastened as fast as they could over the
rocks to where they were. Endless discussions were
held over them; our poor donkeys must have been much
astonished at their sudden importance.

<p>Some of the peasants, especially women, were most
anxious to explore the hidden recesses of our tents,
but this could not be permitted. Our gipsies were
very well conducted, and quiet in their demeanour, as
befitted the day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>After dinner Esmeralda, who had washed and dressed
herself in her robe with silver buttons, accompanied us
for a quiet stroll to the shores of the lake; her brothers
were left in charge of the tents. The distance was not
very far. Seated on a wooded knoll above the shores of
the lake, we watched its silvery waters and the picturesque
outline of the Kjölen mountain; its patches of
snow near the summit were not yet melted by the
summer’s sun. How enjoyable was life in the wild mountains
near the smooth lake whose silvered waters seem ever
smiling; all seemed in repose as we breathed the pure
air of heaven. The lake, we understood, was called the
Logan Vand. A peasant woman, at a house near the
lake, asked us to come in, both going and returning, but
we preferred the open air.</p>

<p>We returned to tea at about seven o’clock. A large
number of peasants were scattered in all directions about
our camp and round the donkeys. Four eggs were
boiled for our tea, with bread and butter. After tea, we
presented our friend, the boy who spoke English, with
“Views of Jerusalem and its Environs.” The boy read
a passage, <i>vivâ voce</i>, from it in English with great correctness
and good accent; the present pleased him very
much, and we were glad we had thought of giving it to
him. If we spoke to a peasant a crowd immediately
collected round us. It appeared to disappoint them that
music was not permitted, but we were quite firm.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock we wished them good night; still they
remained, and a large number kept wandering round our
tents. Some few lighted a fire of juniper; the smoke
blew towards our tents, and Noah rushed out with an
alpenstock and put it out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>The hum of voices at length became less distinct, and
we were thinking of retiring to rest. Esmeralda was
already partly asleep behind her tent partition, we were
seated opposite our gipsies, when another party came up
from the road. One was upwards of six feet high, and
dressed differently from the peasants’ usual costume&mdash;a
tall young fellow with a very long pipe. The waterproof
cover was arranged so that the entrance to our tent was
only about two feet high; the tall visitor, who seemed to
have been enjoying himself, and was rather unsteady, lay
down on the turf, so that he could see us. At first he said
to Noah, “Spille a little,” meaning that we should play.
Then he turned to us, “You speak English?” But when
we spoke to him, he said, “I cannot understand you.”
Then he asked Noah if he spoke Norsk. Noah’s knowledge
of the Norsk language was still very limited. Our
tall visitor, whiffing his pipe in a half-fuddled state, kept
saying in English, “I have beautiful girls, mony, mony&mdash;you
have beautiful girls.” We said, “Nei, nei.” And as
he said something about “den asen,” we pointed in their
direction, and he went off with his friends to see them.
We thought they were gone, when our tall Norwegian
suddenly came back again, and lay down on the turf.
After a pause he said, “Spille a little;” and then said,
“I hear you have beautiful girl; I should like to see her.
I have beautiful girls&mdash;mony, mony.” He tried to pull
the curtain aside, but we prevented him, with “Nei, nei.”
In vain we wished him good night; still he kept saying
occasionally, “You have beautiful girl, I have heard; I
will show you my beautiful girls&mdash;I have beautiful girls,
mony, mony.” His friends, however, seemed anxious to
get him away, and at last, with some reluctance, he left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
our tents, probably to join the beautiful girls, of which he
said he had mony, mony.</p>

<p>At the last moment, before going to bed, we strolled
out in the stillness of the night. We were just at the
moment standing in the shadow of some firs, when we
observed the figure of a man advancing noiselessly
towards the tents. When he saw them, he retired, and
soon after returned, followed by another man. We could
only just discern the two figures as they advanced, step
by step, cautiously towards the tents. They paused.
Very probably they thought we were all fast asleep, and
did not wish to disturb us. They stood for some short
time gazing motionless at the tents, and then retired as
quietly as they came.</p>

<p>At half-past five o’clock we were again bustling about.
More peasants came even at that early hour. The man
from the house near the lake brought six trout, which we
bought for six skillings. An old woman brought some
grass for the donkeys. One woman brought milk, but too
late for breakfast; not being able to carry it with us, we
did not buy it. An old peasant woman, with a peasant
man in a red cap, wanted us to play some music for
them. They looked disappointed, when we said we were
going off at once.</p>

<p>It commenced to rain when we were packing, and we
were anxious to proceed on our wanderings. We turned
from our camp to the road, and bade adieu to our peasant
friends, whom we left sitting in the rain, looking at our
now-deserted camp.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the valley, the views were pleasing.
The rain was not heavy. At Motterud a curious old mill
attracted our attention. Passing through the hamlet of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Moseneden, as we understood it to be, we reached the
open forest just beyond, and halted on the right of the
road. Our middags-mad consisted of tea, fried fish,
fladbröd, and butter. Some peasant girls watched us at a
distance in the forest. A jolly, pleasant old man came
to us, and a boy, with a large hump on his chest instead
of his back. The order was given to load, but no donkeys
could be found; fortunately a stream of water between
two deep banks at some distance gave us a clue to the
direction they had gone.</p>

<p>After some trouble, and a hint from the jolly peasant,
the donkeys were found near the hamlet of Moseneden,
on the borders of the forest, and brought
back. When Noah was loading the puru rawnee we
presented the jolly peasant with an oil bottle just
emptied. The peasant seemed very pleased with his
sudden acquisition of fortune, and showed it to the
peasant girls, who brought down a Norwegian fox for us
to see.</p>

<p>The girls had the fox fastened by a chain. It is
called a “Rœv” in Norwegian, and is smaller than the
English fox, being rather lighter in colour. Foxes are
very numerous in some parts of Norway. The peasant
did not smoke, but the usual discussion took place about
the donkeys.</p>

<p>At this juncture a storm of rain came on, and my
gipsies disappeared with the baggage under the large
waterproof. The peasant contented himself with the
scanty shelter of the trees; and we were protected by our
light waterproof coat. Whilst we conversed with the old
man, Noah now and then put his head out from underneath
the waterproof, and would say “Blankesko.” The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
peasant, looking round, could see nothing, and appeared
puzzled to understand what blacking shoes had to do with
his observations about the donkeys. Sometimes it was
“meget godt,” or a “Romany” word, or scrap of a song,
with smothered laughter from Esmeralda. We spoke to
Noah afterwards, and he promised to be more careful.
Some license we permitted among themselves, to exhaust
their exuberant spirits.</p>

<p>The rain ceased. The donkeys were loaded. Wishing
the peasants adieu, with mutual salutations, we continued
our route through the forest. Scotch firs, and light sandy
soil; no enclosures&mdash;nothing but open forest. Here and
there, the trees were scattered thickly near the road.
Occasionally we came to an open glade. Zachariah, who
had gone on before, fell asleep on a rock on the road-side.
As we came near, he suddenly jumped up, and our
puru rawnee, taking fright, shied across the road, and fell
all fours under her load.</p>

<p>Of course there was a torrent of Romany and English
poured by Noah on his brother’s devoted head. The
puru rawnee was unloaded, and fortunately unhurt. The
place where she fell was soft, with loose sand. Our
journey continued, and at about half-past four o’clock we
came to some open greensward in the forest. The road
made a curve round it. At the farther corner, sloping
from the road, about a hundred yards distance, at the foot
of a wooded bank, near a small narrow purling stream
of clear water, we pitched our tents.</p>

<p>A picturesque mountain, with pointed summit, rose
to view above the dense mass of forest trees which
intervened between our camp and the Logan. On the
other side the stream, a narrow green mossy glade,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
fringed with thickets, diverged to another bend of the
main road through the forest.</p>

<p>Our tents, when pitched, could be seen from the road.
Zachariah suffered every kind of misery it was possible to
imagine from irritation of the skin, resulting from bites
of insects or impurity of blood&mdash;perhaps both. His feet
were the worst. We made him bathe his feet in warm
water and oatmeal, which relieved him very much. At
night, when he was warm, the itching was intolerable.
Instances of this kind only experienced at night without
eruption or rash on the skin’s surface, we had met with
before in camp life. Yet it does not seem to be a common
occurrence in gipsy life. Potatoes enter largely
into their diet in England. Noah’s feet were slightly
troubled with this irritation. When an opportunity
occurred, we determined to dose them all with brimstone
and treacle.</p>

<p>Noah went to look out for a bonde-gaard, and purchased
some fladbröd for twelve skillings, and a pound
of butter for one mark. Just before tea, a boy in a red
cap came to our tents. The boy was a fair, interesting,
slim boy, about seventeen. His features were good.
There was a serious earnestness about him which we
admired. He had a small quantity of brandy to drink,
and he left. Then his father and mother came, as we
supposed them to be, to the tents, and some other
people. They came from the farm-house, where Noah
had bought the fladbröd. The father was a bearded,
thickset, middle-aged man. There was a look of much
intelligence about him. Whilst we were taking our tea
and fladbröd and butter, they all sat on the opposite side
the stream looking at us. Noah commenced pitching our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
tents directly after. When Noah had put up our tent,
and our things were all arranged in it, they seemed much
astonished. After we had shown them the arrangements
of our tent they were going away, when we went after
them, and said, if they came back, we would give them
some music. Noah and Zachariah played several airs.
Esmeralda began to remark upon our visitors’ appearance;
but we very sharply rebuked her, and, murmuring
something about not being able to say a word, she retired
submissively into the privacy of the tents. Upon an
expedition of this kind it is necessary to maintain discipline.</p>

<p>One of our female visitors had a child slung on her
shoulders. When they had left in the still hour of
closing evening&mdash;so delicious in the forest&mdash;we sang two
songs to the accompaniment of the guitar, violin, and
tambourine.</p>

<p>Our health had wonderfully improved. Continued
and incessant reading was now impossible. The mind
transplanted, as it were, to new fields of observation,
gathered fresh tone and vigour. The physical senses
became quickened. The disturbing influences of the busy
world were felt no longer. Seated on the turf near our
tents we were busily engaged writing our notes. The
gipsy girl came noiselessly behind us&mdash;so quietly we did
not hear her, as she came from the tents in her stockings,
treading lightly on the green sward. Silently she gave
us a chuma (gip. kiss). It was a kiss for reconciliation.
We looked up surprised. A peasant boy, till now
unseen, stood looking through the bushes in amazement.
He did not appear to comprehend the scene, nor could
we give him any explanation. We turned, and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
again alone. What could we do? We dismissed it as the
chimera of a forest dream. We had forgotten it; yet it
is upon our notes, and so it is left.</p>

<p>Several peasants were looking at the donkeys quite
late. We alone were up. They afterwards came to our
tents, and conversed till we wished each other good
night. The musketos continued their attacks during the
evening.</p>

<p>The morning was very rainy. About eight o’clock
some people came and walked round our tents. We were
not up. They walked away without observation. When
we got up at half-past eight o’clock, the rain had partly
abated. We were not troubled with musketos in our
tent during the night. Zachariah was much benefited by
the oatmeal and water. A mark’s worth of fladbröd was
consumed for breakfast; this, with the addition of butter
and tea, completed our meal. Whilst we were at breakfast
the farmer’s son came by carrying three calves’ skins on
his back, accompanied by some peasant boys. Nearly all the
Norwegians carry hunting-knives by their sides. Another
boy afterwards passed by our tents with a long pole, used
as a “fisk-stang,” or fishing-rod. After breakfast two
women tramps, or “highflyers,” as the gipsies called
them, passed along the road. One had a child fastened
on her back, and was leading another by the hand. They
seemed astonished at our tents and donkeys, and sat down
looking towards our camp for some time.</p>

<p>The weather being unsettled, we sent Noah and
Zachariah with their fishing-rods towards the Logan.
They were told to try a lake in that direction through
the forest. Directly they were gone, a man and some
boys came to see us, and the man had some tobacco. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
possessed a pipe which he seemed to prize very
much; the pipe had been given him by an English
gentleman named Ferrand, who had been in the
mountains, reindeer hunting. Our visitor was a fine
strong fellow, and said that the reindeer were numerous
in that part of Norway. The hunter was exceedingly
pleased with the tents, as also another man who afterwards
came.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning a carriage and pair
passed along the road; they were evidently English.
We heard one young lady exclaim, as she caught sight
of our camp, “What an awfully comfortable tent.”
A lady in a carriole followed them. They stopped
a short time in contemplation and then continued their
journey, which we hope they enjoyed as much as we
did ours.</p>

<p>A young Norwegian traveller and his wife drove up in
a <i>Stolkjœrre</i>. They both got down and came to our
camp, and asked a number of questions about the
donkeys.</p>

<p>We made a sketch of our camp whilst Esmeralda, or
“daughter,” as her brothers sometimes called her, went
up to the “Bondegaard.” Esmeralda returned with
twenty-three fladbröd cakes, and eight extra ones given
as a present by the farmer’s wife&mdash;a kind, homely,
respectable woman. She was very busy baking, and
asked Esmeralda in, and said they should come down for
some music in the evening.</p>

<p>The rain cleared off, and about half-past three Noah
and Zachariah returned. Noah had caught twenty-one and
Zachariah ten grayling and trout, some of fair size. The
addition to our provisions was very satisfactory. All the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
fish had been caught in the river Logan; some of the
fish were immediately fried, and eaten for dinner with
fladbröd. Noah was the subject of some amount of joking
about his success, and we kept an account of the number
of fish he and Zachariah had caught during the journey.
At half-past four o’clock we started them off again to
the river. After Esmeralda had cleared up her things,
and put the dinner away, she went up to the “Bondegaard”
for another pound of butter, and a mark’s worth of
flabröd and salt. Whilst she was away a militia soldier in
dark green uniform tunic, and cap, came by in a “Stolkjœrre,”
a sort of light cart. When he saw our tents
from the road, he pulled up. After waiting some time,
looking towards our camp, he came down and saluted.
It appeared he had come from the camp near Lillehammer.
As one who had had some experience in camp
matters he appeared much interested in our arrangements.
We explained everything as well as our knowledge of
the language permitted. After he had drunk to Gamle
Norge, he returned to his conveyance. Then his wife
came down, and looked at our tents; she also drank to
Gamle Norge,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and then returned, and they continued
their journey.</p>

<p>The soldier and his wife seemed very quiet and respectable
people. Esmeralda had only just returned when down
came three travellers from their carrioles. Our visitors
were in light summer blouses and straw hats, and had
round tin cases suspended from a strap over their
shoulders; they were evidently men of education. One,
I believe, was from Throndjhem, another from Drammen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
and the third from Christiania. We answered their
questions about our tents, and informed them they were
English gipsy tents (zigeuner). Our visitors were apparently
going to Romsdal themselves. As we shook
hands we hoped their journey would be a pleasant one.
When they were gone another traveller drove along the
road in a carriole, and came down. He was dressed in a
white round-crowned hat, black surtout coat, and possessed
a German silver watch-chain. He wandered about
our tents; we could not make much of him; whatever
we said scarcely produced a word, and we at last left
him to continue our writing. Then he came and looked
over our notes as we wrote&mdash;a breach of good manners
which occasioned us to shut our book. He then walked
away to our camp spade, scanned it very minutely, and
left.</p>

<p>The farmers’ wife came down to our camp with her
three children, and made us a present of some fladbröd and
milk. The fladbröd we had from this farm was the best
we met with in Norway. They made three kinds: one
kind of fladbröd was very thin, and stamped with curious
tracery that made us regret its demolition; so much did
the ornamental fladbröd excite our admiration that we
managed with much care to bring back one specimen to
England. A representation of it is now given, together
with an ornamental Norwegian box-lid which we afterwards
found on the shores of the Lille Mjösen. We trust
the fidelity of the engraving will be recognised by the
farmer’s wife if she ever sees this book. We told her our
music would commence at nine o’clock.</p>

<p>After she had left, an old peasant with a round cap came,
and we showed him our tents and donkeys. He seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
in raptures with the donkeys, and kept exclaiming Peen
giœre! Peen giœre!!&mdash;meaning very beautiful. This
was a common expression of the peasants as they lifted
their hands and expressed their admiration of our donkeys.
As far as we could make out we were near “Lœsjeskogen,”
and the station of “Lesje Vœrk.” On our right
are the mountains of the “Stor Hö,” and the “Sœter
Fjeld.” Across the Logan are the Tœver Fjeld,
Hyrion Fjeld, and the Skarvehöerne. We should think
this would be a good position for fishing, and reindeer
hunting, though we scarcely think the reindeer hunting
of these parts is so good as formerly, and a sportsman
must seek the wilder recesses of the mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_225" src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Our gipsies, Noah and Zachariah, returned. Noah had
caught four trout, and Zachariah one. Although cautioned
specially, Noah had been wading, and his feet were very
wet. Some of our trout were fried for tea. Three men
and a woman came down to the stream, and watched with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
interest our method of cooking. After tea we gave our
visitors some music&mdash;guitar, violin, and tambourine. It
was a very damp evening, and few visitors came. At
last Zachariah broke a violin-string, and the rain commencing,
ended our concert.

<p>Immediately after our music had ceased, Noah was
taken ill with severe rheumatism resulting from getting
wet. Our services as the “Cushty Drabengro.” (Gip.,
“good doctor”) of the party were in requisition. He was
sent to lie down in the tents, and we rubbed his back and
body well with brandy, giving him a stiff glass of brandy-and-water
to drink. All had retired to rest, but ourself.
Hearing voices near our donkeys, we went up and found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
a number of peasants and peasant girls near them. We
had an idea that they had been teasing them. Taking
the peasants down to our tents they looked round our
camp, and when we wished them good-night they left.
It rained heavily as we went to sleep.</p>

<p>Much rain had fallen in the night. We looked out
about seven o’clock on the morning of 13th of July; the
rain had ceased, but misty clouds gathered thickly on the
mountains. A fire was lighted, and Noah was better,
and we made him rub some of our bruise mixture on his
knee.</p>

<p>Noah promised never to go into the water again. As
we were getting our breakfast, the farmer’s son passed
with a wooden bottle of milk and a wooden “Tine.”
This word is pronounced “Teena.” It is a small wooden
oblong box with a slide lid used for carrying provisions.
A box of this kind is in common use all over Norway.
Some of them are curiously ornamented, according to the
fancy of the possessor. For Frokost we had fried trout,
fladbröd and butter, and tea. Two women came to our
camp; one were men’s Wellington boots, and they were
both knitting.</p>

<p>Whilst Noah was packing up, he said he dreamed we
lived in a beautiful wooden house, and were going to the
East Indies. The gipsies dreamt very often of their
Romany Rye&mdash;sometimes Noah, sometimes Esmeralda,
and sometimes Zachariah. It was impossible to leave
such a beautiful camping-ground without regret. Whilst
we were getting our things together three young tourists,
carrying their knapsacks, came to our camp; they were
very intelligent, agreeable companions. One of them said
his father lived at Veblungsnœs. They left before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
gipsies had loaded our donkeys. The weather now cleared
up, and we were soon <i>en route</i>. As we afterwards
passed “Lesje Jernvœrk” (ironworks), we saw the three
tourists at the station. Mr. Bennett, in his handbook,
says it is a tolerable inn kept by civil people. Our road
lay through a pleasing diversity of lake, mountain, and
pine forest. The tourists soon afterwards overtook us;
one knew something of French, and we were able to converse
more at ease. As we passed a house on the road-side,
we observed our silent visitor in black surtout coat,
and German silver watch chain, standing outside immobile
with all his schoolboys. He was a schoolmaster.
They seemed as a guard just turned out, and not a sound
was heard as we passed. The peasants evinced the
usual curiosity. One old woman who was knitting exhibited
great signs of pleasure. One of our tourists said
she was in an “extasy.” We had the donkeys, much to
Noah’s chagrin, stopped for her inspection. The usual
exclamation “Peen giœre!” was marked with much
emphasis. Our tourists had gone on. The old lady followed
along the road. As we went down a short descent to
a bridge, we noticed a beautiful level camping-ground
along the brook-side, sheltered by a few bushes, at
a convenient distance from the road.</p>

<p>The camping-ground was all we could desire; saying,
“We will camp here for to-night,” the word was given
to halt. The donkeys were driven down to the brook-side.
The old lady, who had been joined by three boys,
still walked after us. The gipsies were so busy unloading
that they did not pay much attention to our visitors.</p>

<p>As we suddenly looked round we were astonished at
the appearance of one boy about sixteen; his face was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
completely eaten up with a kind of leprosy (spedalskhed)
frightful to see. The boy wore a cross-belt, and carried
a knife. He withdrew behind some bushes close by,
perhaps to screen himself from observation, when he
saw the countenances of ourself and gipsies&mdash;we had only
had one glance&mdash;it was quite enough. Esmeralda said
she should never forget it. It was quickly decided that it
would be impossible to eat anything in comfort whilst the
unfortunate boy was near our camp. One donkey was
already nearly unpacked, but we did not see why we
should be troubled with the vision of the afflicted leper
whilst we could move to a more favoured spot. Ordering
the donkeys to be reloaded, which my gipsies obeyed
with wonderful alacrity, we were soon again <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The old lady was talking to a man driving a cart,
apparently full of school children. He had pulled up at
the bridge. They were evidently discussing a variety of
matters relating to us. Without looking behind, we left
the poor boy and his companions in complete possession
of our intended camp.</p>

<p>At a stream of water we overtook our three tourists,
lying down. Two had their shoes and stockings off, and
were bathing their feet. Telling them we should push on
till two o’clock, we left them.</p>

<p>Following the main road in sight of the “Lesje Vœrks
Vand,” a lake seven English miles long, and 2,050 feet
above the sea-level, we reached a stream flowing into the
lake. Descending to the bridge, we crossed the stream
which flowed down a sheltered gully. There was a convenient
camping-ground on the brook-side below the
bridge and near to the lake. A few bushes between our
camp and the lake made the spot more sheltered. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
had just unloaded when our three tourists came up.
Before they left we presented each with one of our
gipsy songs. Zachariah in a very short time added a
beautiful pink trout from the lake to our broiled ham,
fladbröd and tea, for dinner. Up to this time Noah had
caught thirty-seven trout, and Zachariah thirty-four.
Taking Noah with us after dinner, we went through a
wild tract of moorland, thinly treed, along the lake for
about three English miles. After crossing some wild
streams, we came in sight of the wooden church and the
station of “Molmen,” which stands a short distance from
the road. Noah went down to the station, while we
lounged by the side of a stream near the road, and wrote
up our notes.</p>

<p>“Molmen in the distance,” we mentally observed. Out
came pencil and book. There was a charm in one’s
existence as we seated ourself on the turf which formed
the bank of the clear pure stream. What mingled hues
of delicious colouring caught the eye as we gazed on the
various grasses, wild flowers and heath which formed the
nature painting of the scene about us. The mind had not
long been engaged in quiet contemplation, when we observed
a gentleman in a straw hat walking along the road
drawing after him a light kind of truck. Underneath the
framework, on a suspended netting, we noticed his knapsack,
<i>sac de nuit</i>, and other articles <i>du voyage</i> for the
use of his family. The gentleman and his light truck
was followed by his family. Three good-looking grown-up
daughters, and their friend or <i>governante</i>; two
young boys in long Alpine boots, holland trousers and
check shirts, and a fine large black dog followed after. It
was a case of nomad meet nomad, wanderer meet wanderer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
each following his own idea, and each, I believe,
thoroughly enjoying his own will and fancy. How could
we be mistaken, there was a joyous expression of countenance.
One rapid glance was sufficient. They were
happy in their way of travel. Far happier than very
many we met in their carrioles or stolkjœrrer as we
journeyed up the “Gudbransdalen.” An interest quickly
gathered round the travellers as they passed, which
riveted our attention. They were gone, we were left,
yet we seemed to regret that we had not somehow made
their acquaintance. Pencil in hand we still lingered by
the stream when we saw the tall form of our gipsy Noah
coming along the road. One mark’s worth of fladbröd and
ten eggs for 18 skillings had been purchased. Noah said
the gentleman who had just passed had seen him at the
station, and finding who we were, had asked about our camp
and wished to see it. Noah told him we were staying in
sight of the road near to the lake. As we soon after returned
towards our camp, the gentleman and his family
were resting near a house on the road-side. Very shortly
after we had reached our tents, we heard their voices in
song, as they walked along the road. We listened with
pleasure to some pretty Norwegian air which came to us
on the wind. Very soon they reached the bridge. We
both saluted as we went towards them from the brook-side.
We were two wanderers happily met. Each following
his own speciality of idea. Each apparently successful
in result. Our baggage was heaped on the ground
as they came a short distance from the road to our camp.
Our visitors conversed in Norsk, French, and English.
He asked if it was not very cold and damp on the ground.
They saw our donkeys, and our various things, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the guitar and tambourines. The gentleman was a Mr.
B., of good position in Norway, who had landed from the
steamer at Veblungsnœs, with his light truck and family,
and had travelled through Romsdalen when we met.
At parting we presented one of the young ladies with our
gipsy song, and with mutual good wishes we watched
them ascend from the bridge of our retired gully, and
disappear over the top of the abrupt ascent.</p>

<p>The time was half-past five; the small amount of success
we had had fishing during our travels was not calculated
to raise our reputation with the gipsies as an
expert angler. Up to this time we had not caught a
fish. Noah had caught fish; Zachariah had caught fish.
Esmeralda had cooked them, and we had only eaten
them; something must be done. Metteramengry<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> (Gip.,
“tea”) was postponed. Noah was told off to accompany
us. The fishing-rods and tackle were ready, and we were
soon on the light gravelly shore of the charming lake.
It was all that could be desired for fishing, yet we did not
for some short time get a rise.</p>

<p>Ah! what! a fine trout heavily fighting; no landing-net,
but he is safely landed, just one foot long. The light
evening breeze caused a ripple on the surface of the lake,
another rise and another trout hooked. Our tackle was
light, and just as we had him at the shore he broke
the fly. It was but the glance of an instant as we saw
him steady himself in the water. At once we were in
the lake, and threw him on the shore with both hands.
The trout was caught, and equalled the first in size.</p>

<p>How lovely the gleams of evening sun upon the lake.
The romantic islets, and the rising mountains from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
opposite shore. Again we have another trout hooked;
this time it is a very fine one. Steadily and calmly we
handled a difficult adversary, and landed our trout without
a landing-net on the lake shore. The trout measured
one foot four inches. Noah, who had caught nothing,
was astonished, and soon after we returned to our camp
at seven o’clock. Esmeralda and Zachariah had our tea
ready, and the largest trout was soon in the frying-pan.
Pink as salmon the trout eat with a delicious flavour, and
was soon consumed with our fladbröd.</p>

<p>After tea the postman pulled up at the bridge. We
had seen him before, and some men came up who appeared
to have been surveying. Zachariah then played
his violin, and Esmeralda her tambourine, and Noah put
up the tents whilst we lounged on the turf, and the men
gazed at us from the road. When our tent was up we
took Esmeralda’s tambourine, and she went to arrange
our things for the night. The peasants left when the
music ceased. It is not so easy to play the tambourine.
Much suppleness of the hand is required. The exercise
is excellent for the arms and fingers. The roulades and
the burr of the jingles with the tips of the fingers require
practice. Noah gave us a lesson when our visitors
were gone. Then we had more peasants. One woman
we imagined wished to know if we wanted coffee, and
did not seem to think we understood clearly the luxury
she proposed. She went to each in turn, and at last
gave us up in despair. The peasants who came to see
us seemed hard driven for an existence, their clothes were
patched and mended, and their faces expressed endurance
and hard life. Noah, who was much better, had a glass
of brandy-and-water before retiring to sleep. After our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
party were at rest for the night we heard the voices of
women, and went out of our tent. It rained hard; the
women were at the top of the ascent by the bridge, looking
at our tents. One had an umbrella. The sound of
talking was very distinct for some time after we had gone
to bed.</p>

<p>The night was wet, and the morning damp and
drizzly. We were up between seven and eight o’clock,
and went fishing in the lake before breakfast, where we
caught another trout a foot long. The breeze from the
lake had given us an excellent appetite when we returned,
and we found Esmeralda had cooked the two large
trout of yesterday for breakfast with four eggs. The reputation
of the Romany Rye as a fisherman after catching
four feet four inches of trout from the lake in so short a
time was completely established in the minds of the
gipsies. We had no means of weighing our fish. The
trout out of this lake are beautifully pink, and delicious
to eat.</p>

<p>Frokost was finished. Esmeralda was putting the things
away. The morning was now finer, and we perceived
passing over the bridge two young tourists, dressed in red
shirts, with white trousers tucked into their high boots,
which laced up in front. These kind of boots, similar in
make to the style of the ladies’ Alpine boot, seem to be
much patronised in Norway by walking tourists. They
appear to be excellent boots; but we doubt whether
they will stand heavy mountain work with the same comfort
to the wearer as our ordinary Alpine boot. During
all our long and continued walking through Norway in
all weathers, the strong Alpine boots made at Medwin’s,
Regent Street, never gave us a single blister. Each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
tourist carried his knapsack, and seeing our tents they
sat down on the road-side, on the top of the declivity by
the bridge, to look at our camp. When we went up to
them, and asked them to come down to our camp, we
found them very nice fellows. One spoke English. The
donkeys were shown them, and the tents; and then we
presented each with a copy of our gipsy song. They
seemed much pleased. Yet, in after years, if they chance
to meet with it among their <i>souvenirs de voyage</i>, they
will again remember the “Englishman and gipsies”
camped by the little bridge and wild stream near Molmen.
After the tourists had continued on their way
towards the Gudbransdalen, some peasant men and
women arrived. One peasant woman seemed, as far as
we could make out, to wish us to stay longer to attend
some <i>fête</i>. Probably they wished to engage our musical
services. We could not make out very distinctly what
she did want. As we struck our camp and packed up,
they asked us to spille<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> a little; but the weather was
again cloudy and inclined for rain, and we at once left
for Molmen. There is a very pretty wooden church at
Molmen. An old man and several peasants were at the
road-side near the turn to the station, which is a short
distance from the road. The old man advanced and said,
“Velkommen.” There was something touching in this
honest and hearty and kindly word to the nomad
strangers.

<p>Taking Noah down to the station, we purchased one
mark of fladbröd, one mark of butter, and four skillings’
worth of soap. Esmeralda had used all our stock of
soap. The quality of soap in some parts of Norway is
indifferent. The kitchen was extremely hot; but we
went into a small comfortable sitting-room, where we
inspected photographs of various eminent men of Norway,
and some carved spoons, during the few minutes we stayed.
As we returned to the road, the old man asked us how far
we were going, and seemed disappointed when we said,
“Langt.” It is probable he wished to see our camp.
Our party were soon following the banks of the river
Rauma.</p>

<p>From the “Lesje Vœrks Vand” the Logan flows
south, and the Rauma, whose banks we had now
reached, flows north. The picturesque lake, from which
these two rivers have their source, is about one Norsk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
mile long. The Logan falls into the Mjösen Lake
at Lillehammer; the Rauma falls into the Isfjord, a
branch of the Romsdal Fjord near Veblungsnœs. Romsdalen
begins at Holsœt,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> near our camp at Lœsje, and
is about fifty-six miles long. The country through
which we travelled on the banks of the Rauma was very
beautiful. Molmen is a good fishing station. We saw
some large trout in the Rauma, near Molmen. The same
interest continued with regard to our donkeys. One
peasant got out on the roof of his house to get a better
view. At one place a peasant came after us, and suggested
we should camp on some wild waste land through
which our route passed, and across which the wind was
coldly blowing. There was little shelter. The place was
not inviting, and we had yet time to be fastidious in the
selection of a camping ground. Having passed “Enebo,”
we continued our route. Zachariah rode on the top of the
baggage of one donkey, and occasionally played his violin.
At length we came to a wild extent of open moorland,
with mountains rising on either side. Over the plain,
detached clumps of trees, gave the scene a more cheerful
aspect. On the moorland’s edge, to the right, hanging
woods covered the base of the mountains to a considerable
height.</p>

<p>The picturesque mountain, called the Raanaa, dark in
its wild clouds, and a mountain we understood as the
Konokon, also the Kongel, the Kolhö, and Böverhö
Mountains were before us. We turned off the route to
the right across the moorland, and halted near a small
lake by a clump of trees, in sight of a picturesque waterfall.
The donkeys were unloaded in a cold wind and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
heavy rain. Two boys came up almost immediately, and,
putting up our fishing-tackle, we followed them, with
Zachariah, across the moorland to the left of our route,
and, reaching the enclosure of a hanging wood on the
steep bank of the Rauma, we were soon fishing in its
stream. The water had a thick greenish hue. The
wind was very cold, with occasional rain. Some of the
throws were exceedingly good; but not a rise, and we
returned in about an hour to our camp. Dinner consisted
of three pounds of our dried meat, from Holaker, boiled
with potatoes, rice, pea-flour, and reindeer moss, to
flavour it. Very good it was: soup first, then meat,
potatoes, and fladbröd, water being our beverage instead
of tea when we had soup. A man and two boys came,
and we gave the man brandy, and the two boys brandy-and-water.
When the peasant took his brandy neat, he
seemed thoroughly to appreciate it, and his visage bore
marks of a fondness for aquavit. A tall, respectable-looking
old man, in an ample black cloth dress coat, with
a belt round it outside, to which his hunting-knife hung,
and large gloves on, came up. They stood in the rain
looking at us, as we sat in the wet enjoying our dinner,
with the exception of the meat, which was too tough even
for ourself and three hungry gipsies to masticate. The
greatest part of the meat was put by, to be again made
into soup.</p>

<p>Dinner being finished, and being extremely wet about
the legs, we proposed to visit the waterfall we saw in the
distance. It was about four o’clock, and Esmeralda
accompanied us, whilst Noah and Zacharia remained in
charge of the camp. Passing by the moorland lake, we
were soon in the forest, sometimes nearly over our boots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
in wet marshy ground, and at other times climbing precipitous
rocks, covered with moss and foliage, overhung
with pine and birch. Our route was devious and uneven,
damp and moist. The vand fos was given up. A beautiful
bouquet of wild flowers was secured, and at six
o’clock we sighted our camp. Our feet were wet through
as we came up, and found our tents had been pitched by
Noah in our absence. Changing our wet things, we had
tea and fried trout in our tents. It was delightful to find
ourselves comfortably seated in the luxuriousness and independent
freedom of our tents, in sight of the forests and
picturesque fields. A gentleman came whilst we were at
tea, probably from his carriole, which he had left on the
main route. As he walked round the tents, he bowed,
and seemed much pleased with a scene illustrating nomadic
life in wet weather.</p>

<p>The clouds cleared towards half-past eight, and the
peasants made up a large fire for us. Then they came
round the tent, and we sang our gipsy song and the
“Mocking Bird,” with the guitar accompaniment.</p>

<p>The weather being new tolerably fine, we went to the
fire and played some few airs. The peasants evidently
wanted to dance. Two beaux of the village were as usual
there: one a slim, short, pale young man, with black
surtout coat; and the other a young man in ordinary
peasant costume. They began dancing together to our
music, and the pale young man took off his hat very
politely to Esmeralda, who was seated in the tent. Finding
the peasants wished to dance, and that the turf was
too uneven, we went up to the road, and taking our
waterproof to sit upon, the gipsies, Noah, Zachariah, and
ourself played them a number of polkas. The two beaux
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of the village soon found two stout peasant girls for partners,
and danced to an admiring audience. Noah danced
with one; but he said she smelt so much of ointments he
could not go on. The peasants seemed much pleased
with the music&mdash;in fact, I believe we were improving.
Zachariah played a Norwegian tune he had picked up on
board the steamer going to Lillehammer, which seemed
to suit them exactly. The pale young man in the surtout
coat, and an active peasant girl, danced to it in a peculiar
Norwegian step. We liked to see them. As they danced,
sometimes the pale young man relinquished the waist of
his partner, and they both turned the reverse way apart,
keeping up the step till they again met once more, and
whirled round rapidly together. The stillness of evening,
with its freshness after rain, as the dancers waltzed in the
midst of the wild moorland, to the sounds of the violin,
guitar, and tambourine,&mdash;a thousand different dreams
crowded upon our fancy. That Norwegian air!&mdash;again
and again we played it, till our dancers were almost
tired. The spectators apparently enjoyed looking on
quite as well. There was the peasant who appreciated
spirits, and many more. They are a good-humoured
people. One peasant girl would insist upon Esmeralda
coming up. The pale young man wished to dance
with Esmeralda; but she would only dance once with
her brother before he went to take her place at the
tents. All things have an end. Our music ended.
Wishing our friends, including our two beaux of the
village, good night, we went to our tents, and the
peasants soon after left. Esmeralda was rather unwell,
for she had neglected to change her wet boots.
Brandy-and-water was administered to Esmeralda and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Noah. The night was damp and cold, and we could
scarcely keep our feet warm.</p>

<p>Rising at about seven o’clock we went again to the
Rauma; but fished without success. The morning was
cold. Returning to breakfast, Esmeralda had prepared
four eggs, tea, and fladbröd and butter, for the party. As
the gipsies were striking our tents and loading our baggage
a man and two boys came, and a little girl with some
milk, but too late for our breakfast. She had brought it
some little distance, and we bought it for five skillings.
Leaving our camp, we passed the waterfall, and crossed
a bridge, leaving the open moorland for the enclosed
road. The river seemed well adapted for fish; but we
do not think much sport can be obtained at this part of
the Rauma. Very soon after we commenced our day’s
journey, Zachariah, who had ridden on one of the loaded
donkeys most of the previous day, wished to ride again.
Occasionally we did not object; but our donkeys had
already quite sufficient weight without the addition of
Zachariah. His brother and sister were of the same
opinion as ourself, and, although he alleged pain in his
stomach, we suggested that walking would be its best
antidote. With a wild waywardness of disposition, he
soon after jumped on one of the loaded donkeys from
behind, which resulted in his being pulled off with a shake,
which, if it did not bring him to his senses, brought him
to his feet for the rest of the day’s journey.</p>

<p>The Shorengro (gip., chief) of a party should be firm.
Camp laws, as laid down before starting, should be
adhered to. In matters requiring the decision of the
directing mind, caution should be used. When settled,
arrangements should be firmly acted upon; wavering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
and feebleness of purpose will soon ruin the success of
any expedition; calm serenity of mind, and good temper
through all difficulties, is indispensable. The peasants
showed the same anxiety as usual to see our donkeys.
The former station at Nystuen is now discontinued.</p>

<p>Before we reached Stueflaaten a reindeer-hunter came
to us in the road, a thick-set intelligent man, dressed in
good clothes and wearing long boots. The hunter spoke
a little English. We went with him up to his house,
close to the road. The large family room, used as kitchen
and general room, was as badly ventilated as usual.
Very seldom we ventured into the close atmosphere of
the Norwegian farm-houses. There are, no doubt, exceptions.
Many of the houses have very small windows,
which do not open, and they are therefore closed winter
and summer. The musketos and flies and heat are kept
out, but then it is generally at the cost of fresh air, that
invaluable health-producer, too lightly estimated. The
room had a trap-door in the floor, with a ring to it,
which somehow we always connect with a scene of
mystery; some adventure requiring to be worked out
with a melodramatic <i>dénouement</i>. The reindeer-hunter’s
wife furnished us with some butter, two eggs, and some
fladbröd, for which we paid one mark three skillings.
The butter was of dark yellow colour, but we found it
good. They had a very primitive weighing-machine,
a short piece of round wood with a knob at one end,
and a small hook at the other. The article to be weighed
is hung on the hook, and the machine is balanced on the
finger at certain marks, which indicate the weight. Several
carved spoons, and an ingeniously carved butter-cup,
were produced. For the butter-cup, which the reindeer-hunter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
had carved himself, he wanted three marks. At
our request he reached a “Psalmodion” down&mdash;a very
primitive Norwegian instrument&mdash;one string stretched
over a flat board, played with a kind of fiddle-bow.
The sound is neither harmonious or lively, though the
hunter, who played it, was probably a good performer.
There was much that was ancient and belonging to a
past age, in the house. We afterwards bought one of
his carved wooden spoons for ten skillings, which seemed
to please the reindeer-hunter very much. The carved
spoon was given to Esmeralda, and ultimately broken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_244" src="images/i_244.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PRIMITIVE WEIGHING MACHINE.</p></div>

<p>The station of Stueflaaten stands upon a rise of
ground forming a kind of promontory, round which the
road circles, so that you can walk up one side to the
station and descend on the other into the road. There
is a sort of balcony, with seats round it, and steps up
to it, in front of the entrance door. A very civil hostess&mdash;we
took her for such&mdash;met us from the kitchen. They
had also an inner room, in which a large fire was burning.
Our stores were replenished with three marks’
worth of fladbröd, potatoes, and twelve eggs. The people
of the station came down to see our donkeys. At a
short distance from Stueflaaten the route descends the
side of steep rocky cliffs by a zig-zag road cut through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the rocks. A large expanse of fjeld and forest, broken
and intersected by rushing torrents, leaving nothing but
streaks of white foam visible in the distance, converged
to the deep, deep, narrow romantic valley we were now
entering. The day had become fine and beautiful. We
gazed in silence as we commenced our descent down the
road, carried in a slanting direction to an angle, so as to
render the way less difficult and steep. At a very short
distance after we had turned the angle of the road a
halt was called. In a recess covered with wild flowers,
and bushes on the top of the sloping bank, above the
road, we found sufficient room for our middags-mad.</p>

<p>The broken bank was overhung by steep rocks. The
fire was soon lighted. Esmeralda peeled some potatoes.
An excellent soup was made from our stock of yesterday,
to which was added the dried meat from Holiaker,
to be boiled a second time with potatoes, Liebig’s
essence, and a quantity of wild sorrel. What a beautiful
scene! What numberless streams dashing in their
deep-worn watercourses into the blue waters of the
Rauma, which loses itself in the deep ravine of the
narrow valley; so we stayed until it was found to be
six o’clock. Hastily loading again we followed the
gradual descent of the road. Before us rose the
singularly shaped mountain, said to be the Dontind.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
Its shape is peculiar, with its escarped precipices and
snowy summit. A very picturesque waterfall came dashing
down the rocks to our right, and close by stood a
very small wooden mill, with its simple and primitive
method of grinding. The miller was there as we looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
in, and had just room to stand inside. He was grinding
oats. If many articles of food are not so fine in quality
in Norway, there is one satisfaction, that what you have
is generally genuine.</p>

<p>At last we came to where the Rauma, at a short
distance from the road, enters a deep gorge, and forms
the beautiful fall of the Sœndre Slettefossen. The river
passes through a deep chasm of rock, and is spanned by
a narrow log bridge. Not far from the fall, on the
opposite side of the road, we found some rough broken
ground at the back of a rocky cliff. An old carriage-way
had once gone through the rocks, but was now
stopped up, so that we found ourselves on a comfortable
platform above the main road.</p>

<p>The view was beautiful. The donkeys were driven up,
and quickly unloaded. An old peasant man and woman,
and one or two children were there, as if they had been
forewarned of our arrival, and were ready to receive us.
Out came our silver-mounted brandy-flask. It was of
handsome spiral shape and formed of glass. How it
escaped being broken we could never make out, but we
have it now. The old man and woman drank their
brandy, and seemed much pleased. They plucked some
grass to feed the donkeys. Very soon other peasants
came, and a reindeer-hunter, who spoke some English.
The hunter was a very civil intelligent man; he could
read English, and spoke it tolerably well, telling us there
were many reindeer, and he would go with English
gentlemen shooting them.</p>

<p>Our evening meal was soon ready, four eggs, fladbröd,
butter, and tea. The peasants were told that after our
tents were pitched they should have some music. Two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
of my tent-rods were broken, and we had to splice them&mdash;.
In consequence of the loss of our kettle-prop we were
obliged to make holes for our tent-rods with the sharp
point of one of Tennant’s geological hammers. Whilst
the tents were being pitched we continued our <i>notes de
voyage</i>.</p>

<p>The peasants were not numerous, but they were appreciative
as we played. It was interesting to watch their
kindly countenances as they gazed on the nomads, with
their tents and donkeys, on the sheltered platform of a
rocky cliff above the Rauma. When our music ended,
and we wished them good night, they did not remain
about our tents, but quietly left us to take our rest.

<p>It was a charming night. The Rauma foamed beneath
and lulled us to sleep. The snow-covered and singularly
shaped “Dontind” towered in the distance above the
valley.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock the next morning we were up and
had breakfast, tea, fladbröd, and butter. Whilst the
gipsies were loading, we went to the log bridge, and
viewed the picturesque fall of the Rauma, the “Sœndre
Slettefossen,” foaming through high and overhanging
rocks. Returning soon afterwards to our camp, we found
Noah and Esmeralda in high dudgeon. A gale at sea,
a simoom, or even an earthquake, could only be compared
to it. The gist of Noah’s wrong was some real
or fancied neglect on the part of Esmeralda to pack one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
pocket properly. In travelling our tent-cover, rugs,
wardrobe, and a number of minor articles, were packed
into one pocket, which was placed on the puru rawnee,
and formed a pad for the other things she carried to rest
upon. To avoid injury to the animal’s back it was, therefore,
very essential that all hard substances should be
placed in the corners of the pocket, so that they should
not bear upon the animal’s back. It was necessary to use
great care, especially during the long and difficult journey
we had before us. Pouring oil on the troubled waters
of the boro panee (gip., sea), we started with the thermometer
at 78° Fahrenheit. All soon subsided into tranquillity
and friendly feeling.</p>

<p>The sun now became very hot. Everywhere we were
greeted with the same excitement, and the donkeys were
much admired; grass was at times given them, and a
friendly welcome to ourselves. Descending the beautiful
road on the right side of the narrow valley, with pleasant
farms below us on the slopes to the Rauma, we reached the
post station of Ormein. Beautifully situated as it is, this
station would be excellent quarters, and a comfortable
resting place for the lover of nature, and the fisherman.
There was a general rush as we came up. The donkeys
were surrounded, and water and grass were brought for
them. We went into the station and purchased a large loaf
of bread, some excellent crisp fladbröd, a pound of good
butter, and two kinds of Norwegian soap, for one mark
and twenty skillings. There was a bed in the kitchen,
covered with an animal’s skin. The fire was made on a
raised hearth, the chimney rising straight from it, but without
contact with the sides of the room; so that there is
great economy of heat obtained. As you look from the station
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
to the “Alter Hö” on the other side the valley, the
picturesque vandfos, called Vermedalsfossen, dashes down
the mountain side through wild and moss-covered craigs
to the Rauma. From this place the Dontind or Storhœtten
may be ascended. Leaving the kind and civil people
of Ormein about half-past twelve o’clock, we continued
our journey on the right bank of the Rauma. The road
was still inclosed, and the immediate banks of the Rauma
were cultivated for hay, potatoes, and grain, which
seemed to thrive in sheltered situations. At length the
mountains became more steep, lofty, and rugged on either
side the valley, which formed a narrow flat through which
the now level road ran. Coming to a gate we entered a
space of wild broken ground open to the Rauma, which
was close to the road. A very large mass of rock pitched
on end, looking not unlike the representations of the celebrated
English rocking-stone in Cornwall, stood not far
from the gate, to the right of the road. The open green
sward was margined by thick and tangled brushwood,
rising immediately to the mountain precipices which overhung
the valley. At a short distance beyond, the lofty mural
steeps of a snow-covered mountain seemed to leave no possible
outlet. Towering precipices of barren rock rose almost
at once from the banks green with foliage on the opposite
side to Rauma. Cascades fell in fleecy clouds of spray on
either side into the valley below; we were never tired of
watching them. The banks of the Rauma were low, the
stream broad and broken in its course, and had a thousand
rippling eddies and swirls formed by its rough and
uneven bed. Birch-woods clothed the lower sides of the
valley. One small log cottage in the distance, close to
the road and near the river, was the only sign of human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
life we could see. The marks of bivouac fires under the
shelter of the large leaning rock showed that it was a
favourite halt for wayfarers.</p>

<p>The tents were pitched on a dry hillock near the low
bushes beyond the leaning rock. We had just said to
the gipsies that we should shortly see a peasant perched
on a rock or on the top of a mountain, when two peasants
immediately appeared, and some brandy was handed to
them. One drank his glass with evident satisfaction,
but the other pointed to his chest, so his companion
swallowed his share. They got some grass for the donkeys,
and afterwards left. A boy, who was travelling on foot
with a satchel and his coat hanging from it, came from
the road; he wore long boots much patched, home-spun
brown trowsers, and waistcoat to match, with large black
buttons having a flower on them in relief. Poor fellow,
he was delighted with the animals, and for a considerable
time sat watching them, with a smile of intense satisfaction
on his countenance. The donkeys, we think, began to
feel their social position in the animal world much elevated.
The boy at last went some distance up the steep side of
the mountain to get grass for them. He first ascertained
from us that they eat grass, which he might have seen
had he noticed what they were doing. Some weak
brandy-and-water was offered to him, but he declined to
drink it. The musical box was set playing near him
as he lay on the grass, and he seemed delighted. Another
boy came, and they seemed very reluctant to tear themselves
away from our donkeys, but at last they left.</p>

<p>After a dinner of tea, ham, eggs, fladbröd, and butter,
Noah washed his shirt, and went fishing with Zachariah.
Esmeralda went to the river to wash some of our things,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
and we lounged by the tents. Several peasants came to
see the donkeys.</p>

<p>The scenery of the valley was charming, and the evening
wore on till six o’clock. First Zachariah returned dripping
with wet, looking like a water elf fresh from the Rauma.
He produced a grayling more than a pound weight, and
some small trout, and related that he had nearly caught
the grayling, and was getting it to the bank when the fly
came out of its mouth. In an instant he plunged in,
and threw it out. As he was changing his wet things,
which we at once insisted upon, some people passed along
the road who seemed much amused, and he had to play
at hide-and-seek round the large rock to conceal himself.
We rubbed him over with brandy, and he went fishing
again.</p>

<p>Esmeralda, who had completed her washing, made tea,
and whilst we were finishing our meal, some carriers came
up and halted near the rock. They were informed they
might have the use of our fire. Zachariah’s tea was put
by for him. The carriers were rough, hardy men, well-dressed,
and respectable in appearance. They had a
light cart heavily laden. One of them sat down, and
producing a quantity of fladbröd from a tine (pronounced
teena) and a small wooden box of butter, commenced
leisurely consuming his provisions. Most of the peasants
we met chew tobacco. We often saw them produce
a quid from their pockets, and, putting it in their mouths,
spit in all directions. Snuff-taking did not seem to be a
habit. The carriers said they had come from Veblungsnœs,
and had halted to rest their horses, and would not
remain the night. They were delighted with our tents,
the interior fittings, and especially with the donkeys.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>It was after ten o’clock when Zachariah returned with
his eyes sparkling with fire, and seventeen small trout.
The usual animated discussion arose between the gipsies
as to who had caught the most fish. “Now then, Lucas,”
Noah would vociferate, “I say you have only caught
twenty-three.” “What, only twenty-three?” Zachariah
would answer, his eyes wildly flashing with excitement,
and shouting in a still higher key, “No such thing,
Noah.” “Now you count, Mr. Smith; here are seventeen,
and nine before, make twenty-six.”</p>

<p>What a picture study! wild valley, night-fall, two
excited gipsies, ourself arbitrator, trout lying near on
the turf, hanging rock, camp fire, gipsy girl standing by
the tents, roar of river, dark gloom of precipices above
our camp. Can we forget the scene? About ten o’clock
several peasant girls arrived to lend more romance to
the evening incidents. One or two old men in red caps
also arrived. The night was beautiful; we sat down on
the turf outside our tents, Zachariah boshamengro (gip.,
violin-player), myself with castanets, and Esmeralda with
her tambourine. Bowing to the peasants, we said in
our best Norwegian, “Ver so artig tage en stole” (be so
good as to take a seat), pointing to the turf, upon which
they sat down. After some music an intelligent-looking
young Norwegian played some Norwegian tunes on an
accordion he had brought. It was not in very good tone,
but we were glad to hear the Norwegian airs he played.
Then we suggested a dance.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Esmeralda, “look at that Rackly a salin
at Noah.”</p>

<p>Noah at once got up, and whilst a young peasant was
apparently trying to prevail upon her to dance, Noah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
seized her round the waist; the ice was broken, and they
whirled round in a polka on the turf. Then the young
peasant took her for a partner; she was a nice-looking
girl, but wanted rather more agility of step. The Norwegian
girls, as a rule, want the elasticity of the southern
belles. Norwegian girls have, however, a quiet and
kindly expression of all that is good and sweet in disposition,
and true-hearted feeling. What a contrast between
them and the dark-eyed olive-complexioned girl of the
south. Equally in contrast the warm-blooded animation
of the southern girl, when roused by the excitement of
some strong and sudden emotion.</p>

<p>Only one Norwegian peasant girl joined in the evening
green-sward waltz. The accordion-player had his dance
with the Rankny<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Rackly (gip., pretty girl), as the gipsies
called her. We played two more tunes for them, and
when we had finished we wished them good night, and
they left. The carriers then departed on their journey,
and as we were going to bed some more came up and
halted for the night by the leaning stone. The newly-arrived
immediately went to the donkeys, and got some
grass for them. One man brought me something to drink,
but we declined it with thanks. To one we gave some
tobacco for his pipe, and, retiring to our tents, we were
soon all asleep.</p>

<p>Another Sunday. We lay unusually late&mdash;nine o’clock.
The morning was not inviting, but very dull and cloudy.
The rain fell fast, and we could hear the roar of many
waterfalls down the precipitous sides of the lofty mountains
above us. The sound of the river and the roar of
waterfalls in a wild valley were conducive to sleep. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
gipsies soon had a fire under the shelter of the leaning
rock. The carriers were gone. Our frokost consisted of
tea, fried trout, bread, and potted tongue. After breakfast
Noah and Zachariah rode the donkeys, in search of
bread and butter. We stayed in our tent writing. Some
peasants came, from time to time, to look at our camp
and donkeys.</p>

<p>As we were writing before dinner, we observed several
carrioles coming along the road <i>en route</i> towards Ormein.
The carriole is a light easy carriage, admirably suited for
a hilly land, and well adapted to the small sure-footed
ponies of the country. The only objection we are disposed
to make is the necessity of travelling along the road alone;
if with friends, you post from one station to another, at
some distance apart, without being able to hold much
converse or communication. In this instance the carrioles
followed, one after the other, at some short distance. As
they passed our tents and the hanging stone, two of the
travellers, in knickerbockers and Scotch caps, appeared
to be Englishmen. The driver of one of the carrioles was
dressed in black, and appeared to be a Norwegian. The
animal he drove was rather larger than a pony, and
apparently timid and shy. Suddenly the horse swerved,
and the driver checked him rather sharply. In a
moment both shafts broke through with a crash. The
traveller got out; the horse remained still. We went
down to the broken carriole, and said it was unfortunate.
The traveller said something quietly in Norsk. Returning
to the tents, Esmeralda gave me some rope. In the
meantime two or three of the other <i>voyageurs</i> came back
from their carrioles, including one of the Englishmen
in knickerbockers. Three of the party seemed Norwegians.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Very few words were said&mdash;they were men of
action. In less time than it has taken us to write this, the
broken carriole was fastened with the rope they brought
with them to a stolkjœrre. The other travellers went
forward, and getting into their carrioles, they were all
soon out of sight. Noah and Zachariah met them as they
returned, in pouring rain, from a farm, where they had
purchased butter and excellent fladbröd. The people were
very kind, and gave them some milk, and the donkeys
grass. They were both very wet; but had no change.
At two o’clock, a second tin of Australian meat was
opened. We had tea, Australian preserved meat, potatoes,
and fladbröd. The Australian meat was excellent,
and a very good dinner we all made. From our tents we
could see very plainly all who travelled along the road.
During the afternoon a close carriage drawn by three
horses abreast pulled up, and a lady and children inside
seemed much interested. A gentleman outside said to
them, the tent is waterproof. They all stayed for a short
time, looking from the road at the fragile abri which
sheltered us from the elements. Several peasants arrived,
and immediately went to see the donkeys. We gave two
of the peasants some tobacco, and one brought us a steel
pen which we had dropped on the turf near our camp.
They wanted us to “spille” a little; but it was Sunday,
and we made it a day of rest. It rained heavily during the
afternoon. Thick mist clung to the summits of the steep
and lofty mountains. Noah, Esmeralda, and Zachariah
all fell asleep till seven or eight o’clock.</p>

<p>A Sunday on the banks of the Rauma.&mdash;With how
much pleasure we welcomed a day ordained for the
world’s especial rest. To our party it was welcome after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the wanderings of each preceding week. This Sunday
was also Esmeralda’s birthday, and we had wished her
happiness.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> One could not help feeling regret as we
reflected upon the condition of these light-hearted wanderers.
Esmeralda knew one prayer. We hoped on our
return to England to have her confirmed. With all
their waywardness, wilfulness, impulsiveness, irrepressible
energy, and at times apathetic listlessness, careless alike
of to-day or to-morrow, there were still some redeeming
points of character, gleams of sunshine, which gave
uncertain glamour to their mystic fate.</p>

<p>We talked to some of the peasant visitors as well as
we could. They sat at our tent entrance. One young
peasant came in with his pipe, and began to smoke
and spit in all directions. When he understood that
no smoking was allowed inside, he seemed annoyed at
his own forgetfulness, and took his seat again at the tent
entrance.</p>

<p>There is a high principle of character about the Norwegian
people, which won our respect and esteem. It was
not on one occasion, but many occasions, that we had
instances of their strict probity. Many are poor; but they
are honest. That conscious feeling of good intention,
produces the manly bearing, and national independence
of spirit, with which the Norwegian people are so largely
imbued.</p>

<p>Many of the peasants wished particularly to know what
the donkeys cost, and were often loud in their exclamation,
“peen giœre,” “peen giœre,” as they walked round
them.</p>

<p>Yesterday the temperature had been, at three o’clock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
up to 90° Fahrenheit; to-day, in the evening, it was only
68°; towards seven o’clock it became cold. Between
seven and eight o’clock we had tea of fried grayling,
fladbröd, and butter.</p>

<p>After tea, taking Noah and Zachariah with us, we went
to see a beautiful waterfall not very far along the valley,
on the right of the road going to Veblungsnœs. The spray
from it was at times blown in thin mist across the road.
The steep, dark gray rocks of the “Sjiriaglns,” as we understood
the name (it was so written down for us, but we
do not find it marked in any of our maps), overhung the
road. In the picturesque gorge of this part of the valley
three diminutive log houses stood at some short distance
apart from each other&mdash;the lowly shelter of the peasants
of this rugged glen. What must be the life of these
poor people! How hard their fare! but still they seemed
contented. It may be they have a larger share of happiness
than we could imagine possible. When we returned
to the tents Zachariah tried to dry his trousers at a fire at
the hanging rock.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Noah and Zacharia had been very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
wet in the morning. Noah had no change of trousers.
Zachariah’s were soon smoked and singed, as the legs
were stretched out on two crossed sticks fastened together,
giving them the appearance of a mawkin to frighten the
birds. Ultimately, at bed-time, it was stuck up within
the tents near the water-cans and other things. As we
were going to sleep, the unfortunate mawkin fell down
with a tremendous clatter amongst the cans. Noah said it
was a ghost. Zachariah pushed it at Noah. Noah sent
it spinning at Zachariah. “Now then, Abel!” “Here,
Lucas!” Bang went the mawkin into the pans again.
We got up to lay the ghost, and ejected the mawkin
forcibly from the tent; but in doing so our leg accidentally
caught a can full of water, which emptied itself into
Zachariah’s blankets. Zachariah’s hilarity was at once
damped. As we turned to go to sleep, we heard him in
loud lamentation about his uncomfortable state, which he
had partly originated.</p>

<p>It was very wet the next morning. We awoke at seven,
and somehow fell asleep again. The gipsies would sleep
for ever. To our astonishment it was ten o’clock. Our
gipsies got frokost ready at eleven o’clock. The damp
mist gradually cleared from the mountains, and we had
tea, fladbröd, and butter for breakfast. Noah and Zachariah
were dispatched after breakfast to the bondegaard
they had been to on the previous day, and returned with
a mark’s worth of fladbröd and butter. They were very
kind to them at the farm. We made a sketch of one of
the peasants’ lonely log-houses of the valley, whilst Noah
and Zachariah were fishing for our commissariat. The
narrow road winds close to the cottage beneath the
broken cliff. A snow plough lies on the other side the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
road. A narrow inclosure separates the road from the
Rauma.</p>

<p>What a wild solitary existence in the depth of winter’s
snow must the peasant owner of this cottage lead!</p>

<p>For dinner we had soup made of ham, peaflour, wild
sorrel, rice, Liebig’s essence, and the dried meat of Holiaker
for the third time. We tried to purchase some potatoes
from the peasant living in the nearest log cottage to our
camp, but he had none ready to get up. The musketos had
not troubled us much since we had camped in the valley;
but we had met with two large black ants, or, as the
gipsies call them, “creas,” near our tent. They measured
exactly three-quarters of an inch long.</p>

<p>After dinner we all went out fishing, whilst Esmeralda
was left in charge of the tents. Several peasants came to
look at the donkeys during the afternoon. Some travellers,
hastily proceeding, stopped their stolkjerrers and, looking
wildly round, hastened to where the donkeys were quietly
grazing.

<p>The young peasant who played the concertina came
and looked at the fence next the leaning-stone. He
probably owned the adjoining enclosed land. Esmeralda
said she thought he seemed doubtful whether part of his
fence had not gone on to our fire. Esmeralda at once
gave him some brandy, and he seemed pleased, and went
and brought her a large heap of fire-wood. Strict injunctions
had been given, that the dead wood, and there
was plenty of it, should only be taken from the adjoining
bushes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_262" src="images/i_262.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CAMP AT LEANING-STONE, SJIRIAGLNS.</p></div>

<p>A party of English travellers passed towards Veblungsnœs,
and another towards Christiania. One young lady,
who saw Noah fishing, asked if he had caught any. Our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
gipsies returned to tea at eight o’clock. Plenty of fried
trout, tea, fladbröd, and butter formed our meal. Zachariah
was very cold, and unwell at tea, with severe pain in
his shoulders. We sent him to bed, and rubbed him with
brandy, and gave him some to drink. One young peasant
came, and seemed to have ridden some distance to see
the donkeys. The valley of our camp was beautiful.
Like Rasselas, we seemed completely shut in from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
outer world; that portion of the valley towards Veblungsnœs,
by the Sjiriaglns Fjeld, which forms a barrier
of three lofty bastions of rock, jutting forth in rugged outline,
and rounded summit, marked with streaks of snow.</p>

<p>Sterile crags of dark and green rock have here and
there cascades, falling through the air, from the highest
summits of these mural precipices. No egress seems possible
from below. White fleecy clouds of mist gather on the
upper cliffs, relieved by the green verdure which clothes
the sides of the valley. The foliage creeps and feathers
up the high ramparts of rock, till lost in the regions of
desolation and sterility. What magnificent waterfalls
leap forth from the hidden recesses of mist and cloud.
They fall in thick white foam, are scattered in floating
spray, glittering in a myriad of spangles, when illumined
by the passing gleams of sun. Down, down, the white
foam falls to depths far beneath. Birch-woods mingled
with the fir stand forth from their mossy beds, and line
the valley with the richest colouring. The gurgling waters
of the Rauma wind their course along, fringed at the
sides with birch and alder<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>, wild flowers, grass, and fern.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Unceasing moisture gives the freshest green, and a
luxuriant ground of varied colour carves forth a natural
setting, to the romantic woods of birch, the juniper, and
the Norwegian pine, unrivalled in conception, and inimitable
by the art of man.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock at night we were writing these
notes by the leaning-stone, near the remains of our camp
fire, when the old man from the nearest log cottage came
up, and asked what o’clock it was. As he came noiselessly
round the leaning-stone, we motioned him to take a seat,
on a loose piece of rock near to us. When he sat down
we noticed that he was one of those deep-lined featured
men, who seem worn by exposure and hard living. Telling
him the hour, he looked curiously at our gold watch,
which we at once showed to him. This was supplemented
by a glass of brandy, and some tobacco, with which he
filled his pipe. As he sat by the embers of our fire, in
answer to some questions about the winters in Norway,
the peasant looked fixedly, and earnestly at us, and said,
“Meget kalt, meget ice, meget snee,” and he raised his
hand high above the ground. The tone in which he
slowly said these words, in deep-marked emphasis, we
shall not easily forget. Many of his countrymen, he
said, went to America. The peasant then asked
about England, and its climate. He told us there were
many reindeer, and he went after them into the mountains.
No one was allowed to shoot them from the 1st April to
the 1st August. He remained sitting with us, and
talking by the large stone. At last he suddenly asked
what o’clock it was, and when we told him the hour, he
wished us good night, and departed. It was nearly twelve
o’clock when we went to bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>During the night Zachariah was groaning and complaining;
his head was very bad, and his stomach.
Noah was up at twenty minutes past four o’clock, and he
had breakfast ready at twenty minutes to five o’clock.
We gave Zachariah a hot glass of brandy-and-water with
sugar. Our breakfast consisted of the remainder of our
trout and grayling. Zachariah could take very little to
eat or drink. The morning was fine, the sun just tipped
the edge of the mountains above the valley. We decided
to go if Zachariah could be removed, when the sun had
reached us in the valley. We got Zachariah out, and
placed him in a snug corner under the leaning-stone,
whilst the tents were struck, for it was about eight
o’clock. When near the river, a tall young English
traveller passed, who was anxious to catch the steamer
at Veblungsnœs, and, saying the scenery was the
finest he had seen, asked if we had caught many fish.
He was soon after followed by a traveller in another carriole,
whom we took to be his friend. The donkeys being
loaded, we placed Zachariah on the packs of one, and
were leaving, when a man came up just in time to see
the donkeys, with which he was much delighted. We
left him sitting on a rock watching us as we went out
of sight.</p>

<p>The sun became clouded before we had proceeded far
down the valley. The two first cottages we passed were
shut up, but at the third we saw a peasant woman, who
seemed much pleased when we gave her an empty bottle.
The three small homesteads of this part of the valley
were of the most humble description&mdash;far inferior to an
out-building, or hovel of some of our second-rate farms in
England. Ventilation is scarcely ever thought of, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
cleanliness much neglected. We were told that a clever
scientific Norwegian gentleman had lately given especial
attention to this subject, and had written upon the sanitary
condition of the Norwegian people. It rained
heavily as we passed through a succession of narrow and
romantic glens, of the valley of the Rauma. The peasants
collected as usual with unabated interest to see our
donkeys. Purchasing a mark of fladbröd and butter at
one place, and a mark’s worth of butter at another, we
passed “Kors,” and at a large house which we believed
to be the Fladmark Post Station, they came up
to the road, and grass was placed for the donkeys to
refresh themselves. They all seemed to give us a friendly
welcome. The Rauma formed most picturesque falls
and torrents along its rough and broken course. Sometimes
we passed through pine woods on its rocky shelving
banks, and at other times through the cultivated land of
some Bondegaard. As we travelled onwards all was enclosed
from the road, and though inclined to halt for
dinner, we could not find one convenient place. Our
gipsies, notwithstanding the dismal weather, were as
lively as usual, and wandered at times from the road in
search of wild strawberries, cranberries, and bilberries.
They had a plentiful harvest of bilberries, and even
Zachariah’s voice lost much of the melancholy of its tone.
At length we entered a wild valley shut in on the left by
Troldtinderne, commonly translated into English as the
“witches’ peaks,” but we were informed by an excellent
authority that the translation should be the “magician’s
peaks.” Nothing could be more wild and picturesque in
outline. In front, as we advanced, rose the magnificent
single peak of steep gray rock called the Romsdalshorn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
rising to its lofty height from the hanging crags which
formed a massive wall of rock to the valley in the distance
below. On our right the dark precipices of the
Mangehöe rendered the valley narrow and secluded. It
was impossible not to feel the wild grandeur of the scene.
The broken barren ground forming a hillock below the
precipice of the Mangehöe seemed just suited for our
camp. At a house beyond, the peasants were collecting
in the road to see us pass, and, taking Noah, we asked if
we could camp. A man said, “Ya, ya.” The donkeys were
at once turned from the road across some rough ground.
The hillock in sight of the road was gained, and our tents
pitched in the heavy rain. Peasants&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;collected to see us. Some well-dressed boys
also came, and may have belonged to a pleasant residence,
across the Rauma, which we had seen before
coming to our camp. It was with difficulty we could
moderate the loud energy of our gipsy housekeeper; indeed
she required a very heavy curb to repress, at times,
the too boisterous spirits of her wild free heart. Our
tents being pitched, our middag’s mad was prepared.
The Australian meat was excellent as usual, and fladbröd
and butter completed the meal. The butter we had
bought at the farm <i>en route</i> was not good. Our gipsies
pronounced it bad, and it was ordered to be used for
frying purposes. This was the only instance when we
had met with indifferent butter; at other times we found
the Norwegian butter exceedingly good.</p>

<p>The woman of the nearest house showed Zachariah
where he could get water for our tea, and we bought from
her two pounds of very good butter for two marks, six eggs
for twelve skillings, some milk eight skillings, cream six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
skillings, and from another woman a small goats’ cheese
eighteen skillings.</p>

<p>In the evening we had tea, and fladbröd, and the goats’
cheese. The cheese was good of the kind, but the gipsies
pronounced it “ramulous.” It is not unusual to find in
those classes of people, who may be said to be poor,
proneness to criticise what is placed before them, and
often to have a greater want of economy than many who
have been accustomed to plenty. In this instance we
spoke in its favour, and said it was good enough for
our camp, and in a day or two the gipsies took a great
fancy to it, and in a very short time it was all eaten.</p>

<p>After tea we gave the peasants, who collected at our
tents, some music. How we enjoyed the picturesque
scene; wild nature seems to give singular inspiration.
The music of a mountain land has a melody peculiar to
itself. It seems to come forth from the deepest recesses
of the heart,&mdash;those fine vibrations in nature, which seem
but the echoes of other worlds. First we sang them our
gipsy song with violin and guitar accompaniment; then
the “Mocking Bird.” Afterwards we played a number
of airs. Sometimes we played the tambourine with the
gipsies, sometimes the castanets. It rained, but what
cared the Norwegian peasants for rain? There they sat
till about ten o’clock, when we told them that after two
more tunes we should go to bed. The music ceased; a
kindly good night, and they left our camp. Then we
watched the splendid outlines of the magician’s peaks
above us, in the silent night, the stillness was only broken
by the loud rumbling sound of falling snow from some
shelving ledge, to the rocks beneath. As we surveyed
the lofty “Skulnablet” above the Rauma, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
decided to try some part of the Romsdalshorn or adjacent
mountains if the next morning was fine. We retired to
our tent, with all the pleasure of one who enjoys refreshing
repose in the midst of nature.</p>

<p>It rained in the morning, and we could not attempt a
mountain ascent. About nine o’clock we had breakfast,
and sent Noah and Zachariah off to the Rauma fishing
for our commissariat. We had tea, boiled milk, and fladbröd
and butter for breakfast. The gipsies caught some
fish for dinner,&mdash;Noah 10 and Zachariah 9, one being
a grayling one foot two inches long. The morning was
showery, and we wrote letters in our tent to post at
Veblungsnœs; Esmeralda was cooking dinner. We noticed
a young lady looking at our donkeys with the peasant
boy from her stolkjærre; very soon afterwards she came
up to our tents, with her three sisters and a tall young
gentleman, her brother,&mdash;he did not appear in very strong
health. They spoke to Esmeralda, and then looked into
our tent, where we were writing our letters, we bowed,
and they seemed rather surprised at the interior comfort
of our tent. Then taking one of our gipsy songs, we presented
it to one of the young ladies; she seemed much
pleased at the unexpected present, and they tried to sing it
to a tune. Taking our guitar we sang them the song;
their brother took off his hat when we concluded. As we
were sitting in our tent, they sang a Norwegian song very
nicely together. The incident gave us much pleasure, as
it was unexpected; one sister spoke English, she had a
brother a clergyman on board some vessel in England, so
Esmeralda informed us. They had not long left when
the boy came back with the song, and a note on the
back in pencil with Miss M.’s compliments, asking us to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
kindly write our name and date on back of song: we did
so, and they went off in the direction of Ormein. After
our dinner of fried fish, tea, fladbröd and butter, the
gipsies were sent off fishing. The woman of the nearest
house, which we understood was called “Monge,” brought
a jacket to sell to Esmeralda; the purchase of two marks
worth of fladbröd was preferred instead. During the
afternoon we wrote letters, and after tea our correspondence
still continued until 9 o’clock. The peasants again
came, and our music commenced; this evening Zachariah
with the violin, ourself guitar, Esmeralda castanets, and
Noah tambourine. Our music is certainly improved.
The people seemed to live very hard in this valley. One
of the peasant boys, a lively little fellow, picked up a
number of English words; we were asked for another
song, and they left at 10 o’clock. After 10 o’clock the rain
ceased, and the mist cleared away, and the night was
beautiful; we had a serious consultation about our future
route after we had reached Veblungsnœs. On looking at
our maps, it was quite clear we had a very short time to
accomplish the distance to Christiansand; still we did
not like to give it up, and decided that if we could get
over some mountain track from Gryten to Skeaker we
might yet reach Christiansand before the end of the
summer.</p>

<p>The morning was fine, we were up about 7 o’clock, and
bought from the woman of the nearest house some very
nice thin sweet fladbröd cakes, stamped in relief, for one
mark, and also some cream for 12 skillings. A man
came, and we paid him what he required, 36 skillings, for
our camp accommodation on his ground. The tents being
struck, and the donkeys loaded, we were <i>en route</i> about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
10 o’clock; before we reached the station of Horgheim
we were overtaken by the Miss M&mdash;&mdash;s and their
brother; they had been to see the waterfall near Ormein;
we came up with them again at Horgheim, and asked
their advice about our route from Veblungsnœs over the
mountains. In answer to our inquiries, they said gipsies
were sometimes seen about Veblungsnœs; when they were
told our gipsies’ names and ages, they were much pleased
with the name of Esmeralda. The young lady, who spoke
English, said that Mr. Sundt had interested himself very
much with the gipsies, and had written upon the subject.
We told them we had a <i>résumé</i> of Prœsten Sundt’s
works, and were also very much interested on behalf of
the gipsy people.</p>

<h3>TROLDTINDERNE,</h3>

<p class="caption">MAGICIANS’ OR WITCHES’ PEAKS.</p></div>

<p>They told us they were going to take steamer at
Veblungsnœs, and passed us soon after we left Horgheim.
As we followed the road round the base of the Romsdalshorn,
we came to some waste ground open to the
road, and partly covered with bushes. The donkeys were
driven to a shady spot near a small stream of water.
The Magician’s peaks rose immediately above us; at
irregular intervals, we heard about its summits a noise
like distant thunder, the sound was produced by falling
masses of snow loosened by the summer sun; we could
almost imagine ourselves in the Catskill Mountains, where
Rip Van Winkle met Hudson and his spectre band. A
witchery seemed to hang about those grey fantastic
peaks. The middags-mad consisted of fried cheese, tea,
fladbröd and butter, and potted tongue. We can assure
our readers that few can realize the luxury of lounging
on soft mossy turf, after a pleasant meal, though simple
it may be, near a rippling stream, shaded from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
mid-day sun, at the foot of lofty and picturesque mountains.
Half listless and dreamy, We gazed on the singular
outlines of the Magician’s peaks; a thousand spells of
enchantment seemed to chain the spirit to an absence
from all care, trouble, anxiety, and woe, which is wearing
to the grave three parts of the mortals of this world!
All our gipsies were at once in a delicious state of
unconsciousness, in tumbled heaps, as part of the baggage,
lying on the turf around.

<p>Supremely happy in our wandering existence, we contrasted,
in our semi-consciousness of mind, our absence
from a thousand anxious cares, which crowd upon the
social position, of those who take active part, in an overwrought
state of extreme civilization. How long we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
should have continued our half-dormant reflections,
which might have added a few more notes upon the
philosophy of life, we know not, but we were roused by
the rumble of a stolkjærre along the road; it was quite
time we moved on towards Veblungsnœs, and the gipsies
began to get our things together. The stolkjærre stopped.
A tall pale invalid man descended; he struggled through
the bushes to where we were, though the exertion evidently
cost him much, but he conquered; he came, and
he saw the donkeys. A faint smile lighted up a countenance,
expressive in its deep-lined features, of a once
firm and determined will, but now marked with the last
stage of consumption. Enveloped and wrapped up in dark
clothes, wearing gloves, long boots nearly to his knees,
although in the height of summer, he surveyed with a
quiet smile our donkeys, ourselves, our gipsies, and our
baggage. He had a female with him whose countenance
was the exact expression of anxious care, and a young
man who seemed astonished at the weight of the baggage.
What was to be done to show our hospitality. Lucky
thought; out came the quinine, a small tumbler filled
with water, and the white powder was mixed in it; we
intimated that it might be of benefit. Poor fellow! he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
wanted a strength-giving potent draught; it could do
him no harm, it might do him some good. Taking a sip
ourselves, and handing it to him, he drank it every spot.
How did he know that, like Rip Van Winkle, he might
not have fallen in with another Hudson and his band,
and would sleep for twenty years beneath the shadow of
the Magician’s peaks. The tall, careworn-looking man
handed me back the glass, and seemed much pleased. We
gave him the tin cannister which had contained our
potted tongue, with all the wonderful hieroglyphics
generally scrolled outside: it was a parting souvenir of
the nomads. Just as he had turned to go, the tarno-rye
made a dash through the bushes, with Zachariah and
Esmeralda dragging, fighting and struggling with him;
crash, crash went the bushes close by us; the invalid was
nearly frightened out of his boots. What did he know
about these animals, and what habits of ferocity they
might possess? The contention was fierce between the
tarno-rye and our gipsies, until he was brought to the
baggage for loading. The invalid struggled, with unsteady
gait, through the bushes, and, with the aid of his
female attendant, ascended with difficulty into his stolkjærre,
which was immediately driven away. He escaped
the fate of Rip Van Winkle; may the draught he took
under the Magician’s peaks give him health for twenty
years. Some young woodcutters, with axes in their hands,
came up as we were starting; they accompanied us along
the road. On our left across the Rauma, we noticed a large
pleasant residence called “Fiva.” The woodcutters said
it was the property and residence of Mr. Bromley Davenport
and a Mr. Ingram. They must have a splendid
view from the house toward the Romsdalshorn; we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
were informed that three farms had been purchased by
the owner along the banks of the Rauma, which made
the fishing very complete. The salmon in the Rauma
do not ascend above Ormein. The situation of “Fiva” is
admirable; the various bends and windings of the river
round the estate are full of rapids and pools, that would
have delighted the English father of all anglers, Isaac
Walton.</p>

<p>The valley now became more fertile. We passed
through pleasant grassy meads. Our woodcutters went to
some houses on the roadside. We met several stolkjærrers,
whose horses were rather shy in passing our
donkeys. The peasants manifested the same curiosity
about them. Now the valley assumed a more smiling
aspect, and we came in sight of Aak “Lehnsmœnd,”
Andreas Landmark’s House. The Hotel Aak is seven
miles from Horgheim, and three from Veblungsnœs. As
we saw the comfortable wooden house standing on a rise
of ground above the road, with a diversity of green slopes
and shady woods about it, we knew it to be the spot mentioned
by Lady Diana Beauclerk in such high terms of
commendation. In contrast with the wild valleys we
had left, it seemed a sort of oasis in the desert.</p>

<p>When we passed Aak, some ladies who saw our party
ran down from the house to see us; but a turn of the
road soon hid us from them. Crossing two bridges, and
passing a large comfortable house, we ascended the steep
hill to a rise of ground above Veblungsnœs. Then passing
through a gate upon the road, we saw a quiet lane
through some waste ground covered with bushes, where
we told Esmeralda and Zachariah to stay with the donkeys.
Taking Noah, we went to reconnoitre for a camping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
ground. Very soon we came to the edge of the
descent to Veblungsnœs. Pausing a moment to look at
the wooden church and town below, we went to the left,
across a large space of open ground used as a drill-ground
for the Militia; and, after looking at a large wooden
building erected for military stores, we went down a lane
to a gate, through which we saw several men and women
raking up new-mown hay. This quiet spot formed a
sort of knoll, above a small dingle, at the back of the
bondegaard.</p>

<p>A green slope, and wooded mountain, rose abruptly
from the other side of the stream. This seemed a haven
of rest, as Veblungsnœs was to be our farthest point of
travel north, our Ultima Thule. At once we entered,
and going up to the farmer’s son, as we rightly took him
to be, we proposed to come there and camp. Very much
astonished he seemed. When he recovered his breath, he
said something about his father, and went with us
towards the bondegaard. The farmer’s house was of
the better class, and substantially built of wood. We
entered a kind of family room, where the master and his
wife were seated at table, taking milk, and raw dried
salmon cut in slices on their fladbröd. The bonde was
dressed in dark clothes, being upwards of sixty; of
respectable appearance, weather-worn countenance, with
sharp angular features, at once expressive of shrewdness
and cupidity. In social relations of life, he was a very
respectable man. Of generosity he had none in his composition&mdash;one
who would drive a hard bargain to the
uttermost farthing.</p>

<p>The farmer came with us to the gate in a sort of bewildered
state. It was a fine scene as he came along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
with his son and a retinue of peasants and peasant girls
holding rakes in their hands. Then there was the consultation
at the gate opening to the junction of two
deserted lanes. Our imperfect Norsk was aided by signs;
but we plunged through, with Noah standing as a sort of
aide-de-camp waiting for orders.</p>

<p>A consideration was mentioned. “Ah! a consideration!
money <i>penge</i>! ha, money <i>penge</i>! The silver key!”
The donkeys must be seen. Noah soon had them down
with his peculiar whistle. The old man’s eyes twinkled
as he surveyed them. A consideration! we saw crossing
his mind, as the hero in Hans Breitman’s ballad, “He
stood all shpell-pound.” The donkeys were driven up to
the knoll, and our things were unloaded down.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought we, “if we have to pay, we shall have
strict privacy&mdash;private ground!”</p>

<p>The hay was cleared off the knoll, the tents pitched;
the donkeys were put up in the wood above the mown
slope, on to the other side the dingle. Esmeralda said
an officer, whom she designated as the Commandant of
Veblungsnœs, had passed them near the gate, and was
a very pleasant gentleman, who lived in the large house
we had passed near the bridges.</p>

<p>Eggs and bread could not be purchased at the farm.
Some visitors came to our tents after tea; amongst
others, Mr. L., of the telegraph office, who said he should
be glad to give us any assistance. Our visitors did not
stay late, and we retired to rest at an early hour.</p>

<p>It is Friday, the 22nd July. The morning being wet,
we did not rise very early. Taking Noah and Zachariah,
we left our camp for Veblungsnœs, at about three o’clock
in the afternoon. Passing from the bondegaard, across
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
some open arable fields, to an avenue of trees, we
entered under its shade into a small wooden town.
Passing up the main street, we soon found ourselves in a
kind of conglomeration of houses, with short lanes having
no continuance. One open space represented a kind of
square. Alleys, at occasional angles, debouched to the
waters of the Isfjord, which partly surrounds the town.
Veblungsnœs is the port of Romsdal. Though we could
not account for it, we were at once interested in the place.
There was a charm about its silent quaintness which made
us linger with pleasure.</p>

<p>The telegraph office was closed till four o’clock. Veblungsnœs
evidently was buried in its siesta. The siesta,
or kief, in mid-day is claimed by the inhabitants of many
northern countries. The tradesmen would be quite offended
if you went to their shops in their mid-day hours of refreshment
and repose. How different from the American style
of one, two, gulp, and gone! No busy scenes or people
met our view. The extreme quietude of the town seemed
to communicate itself, and exercise its influence on the
spirit. At times we imagined we were in a large ship or
timber-yard, when the workmen had all gone to dinner.
Strolling down a short alley, we were at once on the
strand of the Isfjord. Walking along the water’s edge,
we could not help admiring the beauty of the evening
scene. No one was visible. One small fishing-boat, partly
drawn up on the beach, was just ready for a cruise. Nets,
everything&mdash;even the dried fish, probably the store of
provisions for the fishermen till their return&mdash;were placed
in order. Some curious-looking fish, probably rejected
as unsaleable, were lying on the shingle. One had green
eyes, with its mouth in its throat; two or three mouse-coloured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
fish, equally singular and repulsive, were thrown
near. It is strange what deformity occurs in the fish
creation. It is said that in a lake in Wales the fish are
all deformed. We have not yet verified the fact. Returning
to the telegraph office, we saw Mr. L. All that
he could do to render our stay agreeable he did. Our
future route was discussed, and it seemed quite clear that
it would be impossible to reach Christiansand before the
end of the summer season. The idea that our party
might take baths next occurred to us; not that we expected
to find anything approaching the accommodation
or luxury of ancient Rome. Baths, containing hundreds
of seats of marble, adorned with splendid frescoes, and
whose fittings were of alabaster, porphyry, and jasper,
where every luxury was found that human thought
could devise.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> What the baths of Veblungsnœs would
have been we know not; but they had only one, the
spreading waters of the Fjord, before us. The post-office
was in the main street, and kept by polite and kindly
people. The postage of each letter to England cost
twelve skillings, and those to France fifteen skillings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>We sent a telegram to the Chevalier to announce our
safe arrival; another to Kongsberg, for our letters to be
sent to Lom. It was also mentioned to us that Herr
Solberg, of Molde, wished very much to take photographs
of our donkeys and camp, if we would kindly
consent. We were even offered some copies without
charge, as an inducement. The news of the day was
also important; for the first time we learned that France
and Prussia had declared war, and England would be
neutral. Before we left we purchased a large quantity
of bread, which Noah took into his possession. Leaving
the quiet little town, we at length approached our tents,
where we found two Norwegian officers seated in cheerful
mood talking to Esmeralda at the tent entrance.</p>

<p>They were gayety itself as they reclined on the green
turf. One officer, who seemed about sixty, had all the manners
of the “homme galant,” and spoke some English.
When they saw me they at once rose, saluted, and left.
Esmeralda said the older officer, who spoke some English,
was very polite, and said to her, “How do you manage
with four men?” To which she answered, “I have only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
three men.” Then the officer said, “Who do you talk to
most&mdash;I suppose your beloved Mr. Smith?” Esmeralda
said she did not talk to anyone. The officer then
wanted to purchase a lock of her hair; but she would not
let him have any. We cannot venture to dwell on his
feelings of cruel disappointment.</p>

<p>We were much pressed by the people of the farm to
give them some music in a large room, probably used as
a granary. We went to see it first. The room was large
and lofty on the ground-floor. We consented to play for
them at nine o’clock. The farmer himself we saw very
seldom, and it is scarcely probable that he originated
the idea.</p>

<p>An English gentleman staying at Aak, who had been
to the telegraph office, came to our camp, and sat down
in our tents. From his intimate knowledge of Norway,
he was able to give us considerable information. It was
very fortunate. We presented him with a copy of our
gipsy song, before he left, as a souvenir of our camp.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, chairs having been placed for us, we
took our seats and commenced playing, ourself the
guitar, Noah the tambourine, and Zachariah his violin.
We had a large party&mdash;unexpectedly so, some of the
officers and their wives, and many of the principal inhabitants
of Veblungsnœs; and we had not anticipated
more persons than the people of the bondegaard. Esmeralda
was left in charge of the tents; but our visitors
had so much delicacy that directly we left the tent no one
went near it. What a scene! The room was suddenly
filled with dancers and visitors. One tall young officer,
a fine young fellow, was especially active. We had a
favourite polka for them, which we afterwards christened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
“Veblungsnœs.” Zachariah put all his gipsy nerve and
feeling into his music. Nay, our Romany Boshamengro,
almost rivalled, if he did not surpass, Barna Mihali, the
celebrated gipsy Violinist of Hungary.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Even Orpheus
might have bit his lips; but he was not there. All that
wild gipsy inspiration could do, was done&mdash;tones that
produced a whirl of sensation. Noah did his part stoutly
on the tambourine. We made the acquaintance of several
very pleasant officers and others&mdash;one or two we had
met in our wanderings. They seemed like old friends.</p>

<p>Then Esmeralda came and played, in place of Noah,
with her tambourine. Between the dances we conversed
as well as we could with the officers and other visitors.
Mr. L. was also there. The Norwegian officers have
much military smartness about them. Many of them
can speak French or English, and sometimes both. We
always found them gentlemen. The Militia officers
receive regular pay all the year; their men are only paid
whilst on duty. The Militia men we saw, were fine strong
young men, capable of any amount of endurance. Such
was our introduction to the inhabitants of Veblungsnœs.
We saw almost as much of them, as if we had made a
series of visits to their houses. At the same time we had
escaped the inconvenience of too much hospitality, and
still more, of being obliged to sit in close warm rooms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
which, to one accustomed to the natural saloons of the
wild forest, is at any time a very severe penance. In the
clear light of a Norwegian evening, the younger people
danced to the strains of our wild music; others looked
on, and conversed; all seemed to enjoy themselves. Ten
o’clock came: our music ceased. Specially requested,
as we left, we seated ourselves on a slope of turf near
our tents, and sang, “The Gipsy Song,” with guitar
accompaniment. They seemed pleased. With many
adieux, they left. So ended what may be termed our
gipsy conversazione at Veblungsnœs.

<p>Our gipsies had breakfast ready soon after 7 o’clock,
and taking Noah with us, we found Mr. L. at
Veblungsnœs. With his assistance we obtained from an
excellent general shop, the only one of the kind apparently
in Veblungsnœs, two bottles of very good port wine, for
one dollar two marks twelve skillings, twelve pounds of
brown sugar, for one dollar four skillings, or about eight
shillings and eight pence English money; some brimstone
and treacle for the gipsies, soap, and some small
items came to another dollar. The owner of the shop,
which contained a variety of almost everything, had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
counting-house attached, where he changed for us a
ten-pound Bank of England note, into a quantity of
small money of the country. We forget his name. All
tradesmen should have their name and address printed
at the head of their bills, and give one on all occasions,
so that chance customers may have some
means of reference and recommendation. Noah was
heavily weighted; more bread cost two marks four
skillings, and some sundries, and gurnet for dinner,
made our expenditure nearly another dollar. Mr. L.
had read much in English, and, although he had never
been in England, conversed with great ease and fluency
in the English language. We returned to our camp, to
meet Herr Solberg, the photographer.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful, Herr Solberg was ready with
his apparatus. The photographer came from Molde; he
is a tall, pale, quiet, intelligent man. Esmeralda had
put our things ready, so that our toilette was soon made.
As to herself, she was resplendent in the blue dress,
plaid braid, and silver buttons. Her brothers had very
few additions they could make, but Noah contrived to
buy at Veblungsnœs a paper front and collar, which gave
him immense satisfaction. Zachariah was in a melancholy
temper; no one had bought him a churie (gip.
shut-knife) at Veblungsnœs. His existence was blurred,
his cheerfulness clouded, and his smile was gone.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ENGLISH GIPSIES’ CAMP AT VEBLUNGSNŒS.</p></div>

<p>About 12 o’clock Herr Solberg took his first stereoscopic
view. Mr. L., some ladies, and one of our
former visitors, a Norwegian captain and his son and
children, came to our camp. The stereoscopic view
was pronounced perfect. The donkeys were a success,
and the wooded hill above our camp came out with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
the background exceedingly well. Another photograph
of ourselves, tents and donkeys, was afterwards made,
and also a carte de visite of Esmeralda, standing under
a birch-tree, with her tambourine in her hand. On her
finger is a silver ring, presented to her by one of our
friends, as a memento of Veblungsnœs. As the ladies
sat on the grass looking on, we set our musical-box
to play near them, and so the day passed until 3 o’clock,
when the sun having been too high and powerful for
a good single photograph, Herr Solberg left us to have
our dinner, and to return again at 4 o’clock. Our gurnet
was very good, but exceedingly reduced in substance in
boiling. Upon Herr Solberg’s return, he took another
successful photograph of our camp, and left. The
donkeys are very difficult to take, but by a happy chance
they were exceedingly quiet at the right moment. The
engraving now given, is taken from Herr Solberg’s photograph
of our gipsy camp at Veblungsnœs.</p>

<p>Noah was soon required on duty. Having sufficient
time before tea, we went to Veblungsnœs, and bought
some sealing-wax and glue, whilst Noah went to a
spirit store, kept by an old man, who had all the appearance
of a jovial Bacchanalian. Two or three bottles
of aquavit, or brændeviin, a sort of corn brandy, was
bought by Noah. We afterwards imagined the bottles
were filled with the dregs of one of the casks, perhaps,
the brandy was therefore more potent. Certain impurities
floating about did not inspire confidence. It
was inferior to that we had purchased from the steward
of the steamer at Lillehammer. The brandy was intended
for our peasant visitors at camp. We were
annoyed, but found they were not very squeamish, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
seemed to like it; yet we wished to give them the very
best, and were always ready to give the highest price.</p>

<p>Meat, or as it is called in Norwegian, kiöd, is not
very obtainable. No butchers’ shops are to be met with
at Veblungsnœs. No joints of meat hanging up for sale.
Mr. L. believed that a large ox had been killed for
the funeral of a substantial bonde, residing at a large
house, on the high-road near Veblungsnœs church, and
he would inquire. We had just returned to our camp
when we received a letter from Mr. L. and went
with the bearer to the bondegaard. They could let us
have ten or fifteen pounds of beef, at ten skillings per
pound. We went up some steps from the road to the
house-door; but the atmosphere was too close for us to
remain inside. Going with a man to a door at one end
of the house, he entered a kind of cellar, and we were
shown the meat in a cask. They kindly sold us ten
pounds of the beef, which Noah took away. We paid
four marks four skillings, or three shillings and nine
pence English money value. Being uncertain when we
should have another chance of buying fresh meat, we
thought it desirable to save our stores as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Visitors were at our tents when we returned for tea.
Sounds of voices speaking nautical English met our ear:
the skipper of the yacht “Claymore” introduced himself,
with one of the yacht’s crew and their Norwegian pilot.
The skipper said two or three young English gentlemen
were cruising with their yacht, and she was at
anchor in the Fjord<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> near Veblungsnœs. The yacht
had reached Christiansand about the time we reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
Christiania. We gave them some brandy, and the
skipper seemed quite delighted to see anyone who could
talk English. He told us they had an ancient claymore
for a figure-head on board, and three dogs and a monkey.
On leaving they said we might probably come to see the
yacht before she left.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Sunday commences at 5 o’clock on
Saturday afternoon. As usual, we determined not to
allow any music in the evening, and we heard afterwards,
the farmer, who was very scrupulous upon the
observance of the Sunday, was much pleased.</p>

<p>When our Visitors from the “Claymore” were gone
we were ready for tea. Zachariah was unable to eat
any of the fried meat. Our can of water was boiled, and
our beef fried, at our camp fire, at the bottom of the
grassy knoll, on which our tents were pitched. A clear,
winding, narrow brook, shaded by alder and birch bushes,
rippled below us; the grass was short, having been
newly mown, and the hay was taken away. A fine
bold mountain rose before us, with rocky peaks, as we
looked from Veblungsnœs. The summer’s sun had not
melted all its winter snow. Its three peaks were called
the King, Queen, and Bishop. After tea Captain C.
came by our tents <i>en route</i> to the telegraph office. All
were anxious to hear tidings of the war. Mr. L. coming
to our camp soon after, told us the news, and we all
walked together to Aak.</p>

<p>The walk from our camp to Aak must have been
about two miles. Mr. L. conversed with a young
Norwegian gentleman who joined us, and we sauntered
along with Captain C. The calm stillness of the
Norwegian evening was very refreshing. By some chance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
our conversation turned upon ghost lore as one of
our subjects. Each had our idea. Captain C. related
one or two singular instances of undoubted occurrences.
Wraiths, it has been said, may be accounted for by the
wave of thought in distant manifestation. The body
in one place and the spirit in another; voices as sounds
seemingly distinct, sometimes heard through the wide
distance between two souls inseparable. Before departure
from the world, the spirit sometimes manifests
itself to some loved friend. The wraith has accomplished
its mission, and it is gone for ever. People who dwell
with Nature seem peculiarly susceptible to such influences.
In the regions of the mightiest works of our
Creator’s hand, we find them naturally most prone to such
impressions. Gipsies are not without their experiences
on such subjects. More than one instance has found a
place in our gipsy lore.</p>

<p>We have reached Aak, our discussion on a variety of
subjects, ends in our finding ourself in a most comfortable
room, hung round by photographs of Norwegian
scenery, and seated at a small table, quaffing a glass of
sparkling baiersk öl. The presence of English travellers
was evident, from a marked attention to ventilation. A
tidy pige, or waiting-girl, with quiet manner, and ready
attention, attended to some travellers, who were taking
their evening meal, at a long table near us. All was
cleanliness and comfort at Aak.</p>

<p>Our stay at Aak was brief. We returned to our tents
with Mr. L., who was full of information about his
country. Those who are accustomed to our English
climate, can scarcely realize the length of a Norwegian
winter. It is very cold at Veblungsnœs, from about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
middle of September to the middle of March. All that
we now saw before us, so pleasant and smiling, would
in a short time be covered with a white fleecy mantle
of deep snow. Many scarcely venture out from September
to March, and the cold winds sometimes produce
on the face, not inured to continued exposure, what
is called the Rose. It is a pink tinge upon the countenance,
which in some is not altogether a blemish. Frost-bites
and chilblains are of course the occasional result of
so much cold. Frost-bites should be rubbed at once with
snow. The oil from reindeer cheese is said to be a cure
for frost-bites. Although the cold is intense at times, the
atmosphere is dry and not unhealthy. If the Norwegian
summer were twice the length, Norway would be a
paradise.</p>

<p>The morning was windy, Noah’s tent was almost
blown over. Our breakfast consisted of tea and bread
and butter. Esmeralda was not well; Zachariah was still
afflicted with a churie (gip., shut-knife) monomania. Two
days’ inactivity, and extra good living, was evidently
plunging our gipsies, into the depths of biliousness. It
was in vain we had dosed Zachariah with brimstone and
treacle, until he was a qualified inmate for Dotheboys’
Hall, and a fortnight with Wackford Squeers, would
have done him an immense amount of good. Noah
was always lively. A few hours’ rapid movement would
restore all.</p>

<p>With all their waywardness, and restlessness of spirit,
we had the elements for rapid action, and a physical
energy, with which to push through any obstacle.
Veblungsnœs, it was determined, should be our Ultima
Thule, and striking our tents on Monday morning, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
should seek new scenes in the wild Norwegian fjelds.
Still wandering south&mdash;still on our homewards route, our
little band of hardy nomads, would have to brace themselves
to fresh exertion. What a vast expanse of
mountain, glen and forest lay before us, which we must
traverse, before we again reached the sea.</p>

<p>At half-past nine o’clock Esmeralda was ready to
accompany me to Veblungsnœs. She looked well in her
blue dress, plaid braid, and silver buttons, and her heavy
boots were blacked and shining, specially for the visit. As
we entered the avenue of trees all was quiet and repose.
A Sunday in England could not have been more calm,
and free from busy turmoil and bustle. The town of
Veblungsnœs seemed to have a perpetual Sunday, for it
was the same on week days; there was nothing dull, or
dreary about the place, yet there was nothing to see in
it; it possessed an indefinable charm, arising out of its
attempt at nothing. We left it as we found it, to be
remembered with pleasure.</p>

<p>Esmeralda had been promised to see the telegraphic
apparatus. Our word to our gipsies was always relied
upon by them; if it was said to them, it was done.
Mr. L. was ready to receive us, and the apparatus
was explained, and Esmeralda was electrified. With a
present of a quantity of strawberries from Mr. L.
she departed for our camp, whilst Mr. L. arranged for
our departure in a boat to see the “Heen Kirke,” on the
Isfjord.</p>

<p>The Isfjord is a fine expanse of water. Our two oarsmen
were ready, strong hardy men, chewing tobacco
without intermission, and spitting perpetually. Their
pallor of countenance may have been produced by immoderate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
chewing. The yacht, “Claymore,” was resting
at anchor; the owners of the craft were enjoying a
sporting tour. There is a great enjoyment of independence
in a yacht cruise. Norway is admirably
adapted for yachting; but our time was limited, and
getting the wind, our sail was hoisted, and we soon left
Veblungsnœs in the distance. Gentle slopes rise from
the margin of the Fjord for a short distance, dominated
by lofty steeps and rising hills; here and there small
log houses, being the residences of the peasant owners,
come into view. The small property round each, is their
farm.</p>

<p>The cost of an ordinary sized farm on the shores of
the Fjord, would average about 600 to 700 dollars, or
about £157. 10s. English money, according to the size
of the farm. Few attempts are ever made to give to
the Bondegaard, the picturesque appearance of the Swiss
cottage. With very little more expense and labour, the
Norwegian peasant’s cottage, might be made exceedingly
pretty, and ornamental.</p>

<p>The “Heen Kirke” had no unusual attraction in itself;
one Norwegian church is so like another. No old
monuments to please the antiquarian taste; no mediæval
tombs; no brasses, Norman arches, Saxon doorways,
and decorated windows; no corbels, bosses, and grotesque
imagery of ancient stone sculpture; no tesselated
pavement, and richly ornamented cloisters, dark with
age, and dim with poetic light. No peel of bells, and
massive tower covered with ivy, resorted to by owls,
and jackdaws. No ecclesiastical library of black-lettered
books, curiously and substantially bound, in dark and
dusty covers, crammed into shelves, and forgotten in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
some corner of the vestry. The worm-eaten oak chest
was wanting also, containing well-thumbed registers and
sacramental plate, secured by three large locks, one for
the vicar and one for each of the churchwardens. The
Norman stone font, with elaborate carving was absent.
The crypt and sedilia,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> were not to be found, and a
chained Bible we did not see.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Yet, withal, the people
are earnest in their prayer, their ways are those of peace,
and their pastors appear to hold the affections of their
flock.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful view of the “Kavlee Fjeld” as
we returned. Stretching forests of pine extended beyond
the head of the Fjord. On our left we saw the once
abode of “Parelius,” a wild spot beneath a precipice,
near the margin of the Fjord. Parelius was a great
linguist. No one appears to have chronicled his linguistic
skill, though he learned a living language, which
few if any can. Even the Parisien of the Jardin des
Tuileries, whose command over birds is wonderful, did
not seem to know their language; even Mademoiselle
Vanderschmeck, could not rival Parelius, who lived in
the solitary Bondegaard, on the shore of the Isfjord.
Parelius conversed with birds; he is said to have known
their language. On one occasion some peasants asked
him, when he was in another parish, away from home,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
what the crows hard by were saying&mdash;“They say,” said
Parelius, “that a bear has just killed one of my oxen,
and must go home.” He returned to verify his loss.
Whilst Parelius was from home one day, an avalanche
from the precipice above, destroyed his house. We were
told he lived some fifty years ago. Parelius is gone&mdash;the
house is gone. Whether he was a native of Veblungsnœs
we cannot say. No record appears to have
been made of this eminent man, some account of his
life, scanty though it be, may rescue his name from
oblivion.</p>

<p>The fjords of this coast are well stocked with fish, and
the islands and rocks with wild fowl. The eider ducks
are numerous; their nests are made on the ground, and
the down is taken from the nest after it is placed there
by the bird. About half-a-pound of down is taken from
each nest, which is reduced to a residue of about a
quarter-of-a-pound for sale or use; a very small quantity
of the down is sufficient to stuff a coverlet; its wonderful
lightness and warmth renders it extremely valuable. There
is now a law for the protection of the eider duck; they
may not be caught or killed from 15th April to
15th August.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Fiva is said to have the best salmon fishing on the
Rauma. We had a fresh wind on the Fjord as we
returned. Birch twigs are used as fastenings for the
boat sail instead of rope, in fact, the birch twigs, or
withes, are substituted for rope in every variety of way.
After a pleasant cruise we landed, and left our friend,
and reached our camp with an excellent appetite.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>Our dinner consisted of soup, meat, and bread and
butter. Esmeralda was unwell and could not eat anything.
Zachariah was still murmuring about the churie
(shut knife) no one had bought for him. He received a
lecture; the shadows of his future were forcibly set
before him.</p>

<p>After dinner the “Lehnsmœnd’s” lady from Aak, and
her two daughters came to see the donkeys. A very beautiful
bouquet of flowers she brought for our acceptance.
Lady Di Beauclerk, in her Journal,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> speaks of the beautiful
flowers of Aak. Whilst our visitor and her daughters
sat in our tents, we sent for the donkeys, which were
much admired. Zachariah was presented with a box of
ornaments before they left. So our visitors came and
went in succession during the evening, and our first
idea of strict seclusion, by camping in private ground,
we found an illusory dream.

<p>A note was soon after placed in our hands, by a broad-shouldered
thickset muscular man, rather under middle
height, with a thick sandy almost red beard; his small
quick eye betokened alertness, and self-possession, his
countenance expressed good temper, fidelity, and rectitude.
It was not necessary to look again, as we took the note.
He was a broad-chested, sturdy reindeer hunter, of the
Fjeld; the note was an introduction given by Mr. L.
the bearer was Ole Halvorsen, or as he is usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
called Ole Rödsheim, from the name of his station and
land in Bœverdal. A certificate of strong recommendation
by two English gentlemen, for whom he had
recently acted as guide, and had lately parted from, was
also given us. Captain C.‘s name was also used with his
permission. We at once liked Ole Rödsheim; his quiet
manner, and appearance, was so different from many of
the “Tolks,” and guides, who are often more trouble, and
expense than use; most of them would sneeze for an
hour, at the idea of sleeping on some damp heath, under
a rock during a windy wet night, near the exhilarating
influence of a cold snow field; such were not the men
for our expedition, and Ole Rödsheim was. After a
careful inspection of our maps, we soon arranged in our
minds, the course for our future expedition after we left
Veblungsnœs. The summit of the Galdhœpiggen, the
Mörkfos, and the valders, with a long route through
many Mountain and Lake scenes, we proposed to
accomplish. Ole Rödsheim spoke good English, and
the following arrangement was soon concluded; he
was to join us near Molmen, and guide our party
over the mountains, to Skeaker, Lom, and Rödsheim, and
ascend with us the Galdhöpiggen, for the sum of three
dollars and a half, finding himself board and lodging;
his services afterwards, if required, to be 4 marks a day,
including everything. Deciding to make a forced march,
and travel in two days what we had before travelled
in four, we agreed to be at the Böver Moen (Beaver
stream) between Stueflaaten and Molmen on the following
Wednesday morning.</p>

<h3>VEBLUNGSNŒS,</h3>
<p class="caption">WITH CHURCH, FJORD, AND MOUNTAIN OF THE THREE PEAKS, “THE KING, QUEEN, AND BISHOP.”</p></div>

<p>With what pleasure we looked forward to fresh scenes
of travel and adventure in even wilder scenes of nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
than those we had yet traversed. Those we had seen
were very beautiful; each camp seemed to eclipse the
last, in the beauty of its scenery. On those still clear
Norwegian nights, full of mystic light, lovely in their
starlight stillness, the mind seemed enthralled, in a
thousand pleasing fancies; the music of the waterfall;
the voices on the breeze. The melody of nature, produced
impressions we can never forget.</p>

<p>Norway is not the country for the sybarite, fainéant,
and the flâneur; it is the home of the hardy mountaineer,
the angler, the reindeer hunter, and nomad wanderer,
the lover of nature and nature’s works in her wildest and
most beautiful forms.</p>

<p>Plants, mosses of every hue, trees, rocks, glaciers,
torrents, lakes, fjords, waterfalls, mountains, woods,
and glens, are, in their perfection, met at every step, in
Norway’s free romantic land.</p>

<p>When Mr. L. came to our camp in the evening with
Herr Solberg, we arranged for our photographs, and paid
for them. The views of Romsdalshorn, Veblungsnœs,
and Troldtinderne, from which the engravings in this
book are taken, had yet to be completed specially for us.
They were afterwards forwarded; Herr Solberg was
allowed the privilege of disposing of the stereoscopic view
of our gipsy camp, and the carte de visite of Esmeralda.
The specimens he brought to show us, were presented to
Esmeralda.</p>

<p>Our last walk with Mr. L. is taken by the Isfjord.
As a parting souvenir we gave him an illustrated copy of
Her Majesty the Queen of England’s Journal, with which
he was much interested; Mr. L. added much to the
pleasure of our visit to the quaint old town of Veblungsnœs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
When shall we meet again? So it is in this world;
we meet and we part, but fortunately the memory retains
friendship’s recollection not so easily effaced.</p>

<p>From the Isfjord, near Veblungsnœs, the farm was
pointed out to us where Colonel Sinclair, who perished
at the Kringelen, landed with his forces.</p>

<p>The church of Veblungsnœs is represented in the engraving
of the town. There was nothing remarkable
about this church to note. A newly dug grave was prepared
in the churchyard for the deceased Bondegaard,
who had resided near. If it happens that the clergyman
cannot attend when the corpse is buried no delay occurs;
the service is read over by the clergyman at some future
time, when he attends for church service. The yacht
Claymore added a charm to our evening contemplation
of the Isfjord. Noah said he had seen one of the gentlemen
of the yacht on shore, who had that day ascended
the mountain above our camp.</p>

<p>Our stay was now nearly ended. Hitherto our travels
had through every difficulty, been most successful; we
had scarcely lost anything; the two hats, musketo veil,
and kettle prop we could manage without. Mr. L.
told us that two young Norwegian friends who had made
an excursion, came to him with scarcely anything left;
they had forgotten some article at nearly every place
they went to. With some trouble the things were again
recovered. When the travellers departed, they again
contrived to leave behind them an umbrella and a pair
of galoshes.</p>

<p>Some of the Norwegian gipsies usually attend the
October fair at Veblungsnœs. The women are very handsome,
and some of the men. When they attend the fair,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
the women drink even more than the men. They are
very fond of music, and at the fairs, when they have
drunk to excess, are very quarrelsome and passionate.
Under the Norwegian law any person who arrives at a
certain age without being able to read or write, and who
has not been confirmed, is liable to be committed to gaol.
There they remain until they can read, write, and are
properly instructed in religious knowledge. Many of the
gipsies when examined by clergymen, have been found so
ignorant, and without instruction, that they have from
time to time been committed to prison, and detained
there, till they came up to the standard of required
proficiency. Prœsten Eilert Sundt had therefore good
opportunities of seeing them, and conversing with them.
The vocabulary of Romany words, as spoken by the
Norwegian gipsies, which he has collected, with other
information, is very valuable.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> His mission seems to
have been performed with much energy. The short
résumé of his works, given in the appendix to this
book, we had specially made for our English readers; it
gives some idea of the state in which he found this
wandering and singular people in Norway. The Storthing
granted a large sum for the amelioration of their condition.
We were told that some gipsies who had money
given them, and were settled in farms on the shore of
the Isfjord opposite Veblungsnœs, did not remain long,
and, selling their farms, disappeared with the money.
Many of the gipsies who attend the Veblungsnœs fair,
when asked where they came from, say the Valders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
This was one reason why we decided to return with our
gipsies through that part of Norway. Notwithstanding,
Prœsten Sundt’s account of their mode of life, and predilections,
and the very unenviable notoriety they seem to
have attained in Norway, we were certainly anxious to
fall in with a band of these wanderers, so that our people
might hold converse with them. We were told that
some of the gipsies had land in the Valders! but it is very
possible that the statement that they came from that part
of Norway was an evasive reply. It is very seldom
gipsies will give even their right names to curious
questioners; as in other countries where they are found,
and in very few they are not, they deal in horses and
work in metals. The Norwegian gipsies are skilful
workers in brass; we were told that they live in houses
in the winter, the cold being too intense for them to
travel with their tents.</p>

<p>The circumstance of the non-burial of the gipsy dead
in the Norwegian churchyards, as stated by the Prœsten
Sundt, is not confined exclusively to the gipsies of
Norway. Baudrimont in his “Langue des Bohémiens,”
as spoken by those living in the Basque provinces, says
at page 27, “We know not what becomes of the gipsies
who die; not the slightest trace of them is ever met with.
This has given rise to the idea, that they turn the course
of rivulets, and, digging a pit, place the body in the
torrent’s bed, and again let the water resume its course.”</p>

<p>Francisque-Michel in his work, “Le Pays Basque,”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> at
page 143, says:&mdash;“‘I have noticed in many localities,’
said Monsieur le Vicomte de Belsunce, who was for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
considerable period the mayor of a district, ‘that gipsy
men and women of great age, long known to the present
generation as old people, disappear suddenly, and never
return. It is a common occurrence, and yet no labourer
in the fields, or traveller on the roads, or shepherd, or
hunter in the mountains, ever sees the trace of a grave.’”</p>

<p>And the same author says:&mdash;“Was Grellman<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> right,
or was it true, as many assert, that these people turned
the course of some brook whilst they made the grave,
and turned the stream over it immediately afterwards?
Such a burial would not leave any trace, and it was so
they buried Attila, who followed, when he came into
Europe, the same route as the gipsies.”</p>

<p>The more the gipsy element becomes mingled with
other house-dwelling races the less strongly will they cling
to their tents. We who have tried it must confess to a
strange fascination in tent life. To our own knowledge
we have known instances of gipsies who have married
house-dwelling gorgios. One singular instance of romantic
love was once narrated to me of a young gentleman
of birth, who became so infatuated as to leave all for
a handsome gipsy girl he met with. She left the neighbourhood
of his home, but he could not rest, and, with a
few things, followed and found her, and at last submitted
for her sake to be her husband and adopt tent life. His
end was sad. He was making some pegs for her to sell,
but being unpractised in the art, and clumsy with his
knife, it slipped and entered his thigh, probably severed
the femoral artery, for he died soon after.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>As long as much of the gipsy element remains, it is not
probable that they can be bent to the steady pursuits of
a stationary house-dwelling population. As well try to
turn the falcon into a barn-door fowl; but Christian
charity should lead us, if we cannot alter their nature,
to aid in placing them in such course of life, as may best
improve and raise their moral condition, without requiring
them to sacrifice entirely, those strong and restless
feelings, which seem inherent in their being, and the
necessity of some mysterious law or predestination.</p>

<p>We sat out late by our tents, writing our notes; the
long evenings of clear light, enabled us often to snatch
those hours which in England, would be quite dark. The
gipsies, before we retired to rest, had their dose of brimstone
and treacle, and with many anticipations, we were
soon buried in repose.</p>

<p>All was stir and bustle. Up, Noah!&mdash;up, Zachariah!&mdash;vand!
All were moving before six. Eggs, bread, butter,
and tea for breakfast. Esmeralda had been unwell all
night. Our gipsies had been living well, and without
their usual exercise. Esmeralda was evidently bilious.
She had behaved very well, and was now deep in the
mysteries of cooking and housekeeping.</p>

<p>The old farmer hovered near as if he was looking
out for his quarry. We had scarcely seen him about
before. We were uncertain when Mr. L. would come,
and therefore mentioned to the farmer that we wished to
pay him for our accommodation.</p>

<p>He led the way into his house, and we found ourselves
in a little parlour, comfortably furnished, but without
any ventilation: a picture of the death-bed of King Oscar
in 1859, two prints of the Emperor Napoleon III. and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the Empress, and a German coloured print called Elise,
and Our Saviour, were placed on the walls.</p>

<p>His daughter brought in a bottle of some wine or
cordial, and a wine-glass, but we asked for a cup of
coffee in preference. In answer to my request, the old
man, who sat on the other side of the table, counted
slowly on his fingers five marks&mdash;“Een thaler,” said he.
It was what we expected, and proceeding to pay him, we
pulled out three dollar notes. Not wishing to pay more
of our silver away than we could help, we thought it a
good opportunity to pay one of our dollar notes. Directly
the old man saw the notes he suddenly counted three on
his fingers, and raised his demand to “drei thalers.” It
was of little consequence, and we paid him his demand,
disgusted with his cupidity&mdash;three dollars, or 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
English money, which in Norway was equivalent to the
rent of a cottage and ground for one year for a Huusmand.
What different hospitality the wanderers met with from
many not half so wealthy, who brought to our camp
fladbröd for our acceptance. This, and the one at Lillehammer,
were the only two instances we met with of any
over-exaction in Norway. We were told afterwards that
one dollar was amply sufficient.</p>

<p>We had almost loaded our donkeys when Mr. L. came;
and at our wish a boatman brought up two very fine sea
trout, for which we paid three marks and twelve skillings,
and took them with us.</p>

<p>The militia were to commence their training at Veblungsnœs
that morning. One of our former acquaintances, a
Norwegian captain&mdash;a fine specimen of a thorough-going
military man, erect and handsome, with his grey moustache&mdash;had
come to see us off. Esmeralda stepped forward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
and pinned some beautiful flowers, selected from
the Aak bouquet, in Mr. L.’s coat. A copy of our song
was left for Monsieur le Capitaine’s son; another for Frue
Landmark, of Aak; and one for Herr Solberg; and two
copies for Mr. L. to do what he liked with. The Chevalier
had sent a very nice return telegram to us. Mr. L. and
the Captain were astonished at the weight our donkeys
carried. We wished the farmer’s wife and daughter and
son good-by. The old man was absent, probably gloating
over his sudden acquisition of wealth. His son and
daughter were very quiet, respectable young people. The
farm people collected on the ground, and, saluting each
other with our hats, we left the camp, and passed up the
wide lane leading to the main route. As we were disappearing
over the edge of the ascent, we saw the Capitaine
and his son still looking after us; they waved their hats
as we vanished with a farewell signal in return.</p>

<p>We passed the quiet scenes of Aak and its beautiful
scenery; we saw Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, and some young ladies
coming down to the road from the house. The charming
terrace before the house and grounds are kept in excellent
neatness and order. Frue Landmark also
came down to see our donkeys again. Captain C. was
going south, and might probably overtake us, but we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
did not see him again.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Very useful indeed was the information
he gave us. Frue Landmark, whom we saw in
earnest conversation with Esmeralda, presented her with
some ear-rings. So we made our adieux to all, and left a
spot so pleasantly described by Lady Di Beauclerk.
Her ladyship is the daughter of the ninth Duke of
St. Albans, whose first wife was Mrs. Coutts, the once
celebrated Miss Mellon, whose interesting memoirs were
published some years since.</p>

<p>The sun was very warm. We were all in excellent
spirits; who could be otherwise in the midst of so much free
life? Herr Solberg, the photographer, met us, apparently
looking for a Point de Vue. Then we passed Fiva,
and a short distance beyond we halted in the old place
among the green bushes, by the rippling stream, at the
foot of the Romsdalshorn and Troldtinderne. Our
dinner consisted of some of the boiled beef, fried with
butter. It was about twelve o’clock; Zachariah was despatched
trout-fishing. Esmeralda was better; some
quinine in the morning had spirited her up. She was not
allowed to be idle. As we bustled her about, she said she
thought the Rye was in a murmuring way. Then, as
we lounged note-book in hand, we had a chaff at Noah,
who was half asleep, and woke up looking very wild, to
be asked, what he would take for his paper front, and
collar, for which he had given four skillings. The front
was now all but gone. “What you like, sir,” said
Noah, and heaving a deep sigh, fell back into the region
of gipsy dreams sounder than ever. We looked in vain
for the invalid visitor who was to take the place of Rip
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Van Winkle, and somnolency resulting, who knows but
we ourselves might not have been there now; but the
good genii of the magician’s peaks awoke us. There
were the dark fantastic rocks, streaked in gilded rays of
the summer’s sun. The distant roar of thunder in the
lofty precipices, produced by falling snow, sounded in
the narrow gorge. Our donkeys had strayed; we
aroused Noah from a deep sleep, who disappeared down
the valley and brought them back. On his return, he
said he had seen a number of gentlemen along the
Rauma near Fiva, with guns and fishing-rods. It was
nearly four o’clock. The donkeys were hastily loaded, and
we were again <i>en route</i>. Zachariah was overtaken before
we reached Horgheim, and had succeeded in catching
twenty-three small trout. A young traveller and his
wife came up in a stolkjœrre, and kept behind us till we
got to Horgheim. They wanted us to stay there, so that
they might get first on account of the donkeys, but we
were pressed for time, and when they came up afterwards,
their horse passed very quietly. The traveller,
who was Norwegian, spoke English, and they appeared
a newly-married couple. We passed our old camping-ground
beyond “Horgheim,” and bought a mark’s worth
of fladbröd from the woman of the house. Our old camp
near the leaning-stone was our intended destination. At
one part of the road we met a number of carrioles. A
lady in a green Tyrolese hat and feather, who seemed
unaccustomed to driving, was one of the party. As she
passed, the pony shied, and the boy who stood upon the
board behind her, with great quickness, seized the reins.
“P-r-r-r-h&mdash;p-r-r-r-h,” said the boy, and away they dashed
past us. The boy, afterwards, reined the pony up rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
sharply; the pony reared, and the lady jumped out with
a small scream; the gentleman we took for her husband
bringing up the rear, passed quietly enough, and as no
one was hurt, we again continued our way.</p>

<p>We passed Fladmark; our donkeys had not lost their
interest to the peasantry; many collected to see them.
Fladmark seems a large station and the scenery is very
picturesque. In fact, at every turn we had fresh scenes
to admire. When we had passed Kors and were drawing
near our old camping ground, in passing through a gate
on the road, our Puru Rawnee ran our packs against the
gate-post, and broke a bottle of port wine. Noah and
Zachariah caught some in the kettle lid, which they were
allowed to drink. We did not feel inclined to take any
ourselves. Esmeralda had a very small quantity, but
the stimulant made her feel, she said, very queer. Then
we followed on slowly with her, for she was rather tired,
whilst Noah and Zachariah pushed on in advance. We
were soon afterwards overtaken by a stolkjœrre; a man
was driving two young ladies, and a young gentleman,
their brother, was walking. They stopped after they
had passed us, and seeing that they wished to speak, we
addressed them. The one young lady, who spoke English
very well, said they had come to Veblungsnœs by
steamer, where they had heard of us, and had seen our
song. They wished very much to see our “deer.”
Many in Norway took our donkeys for a species of reindeer
capable of carrying weights. The young ladies were
very agreeable and good looking; something very charming
about them. They seemed much interested in our expedition.
Being told that our gipsies were in advance,
and where we should encamp, they drove after them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>When Esmeralda and myself reached the leaning-stone
in the valley of the Sjiriaglns Fjeld, it was getting dusk.
The young ladies were looking at our things just unpacked,
and Noah was putting up the tents on the old
camp ground near the large rock. The young ladies
wished to hear us play, but something to eat was a preliminary
necessity before we could give them any music.
They decided, therefore, to wait. The young ladies
said, “We should much wish to hear you play; we heard
of you at Veblungsnœs.” Our tents were soon pitched,
and Zachariah, who had given up grumbling about his
churie, got our tea and broiled meat ready with remarkable
celerity. The young ladies said, “We should so
like to sleep in a tent.” “Do you not find it cold?”
“No,” we said, “We have a waterproof on the ground,
and a carpet over that. It is all we require for our bed.”
Then as we were going to tea in our tents the young
ladies decided to take something to eat themselves at our
camp fire.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> They gave us some dried rein-deer meat,
and we gave them some of our biscuit. Noah said they
were such nice young ladies he could give them anything,
and sent Esmeralda with his panakin of tea instead
of having it himself. Esmeralda did not eat anything,
and went and talked to them. Then we sent
them bread-and-butter, and finished our tea. The
young ladies sent their cards to our tents whilst we were
at tea. Miss Grethe S&mdash;&mdash;, of Halsund, and Miss Marie
B&mdash;&mdash;, of Molde. Then they came from the camp fire
where they had finished their repast. The shades of
evening had fallen; the sound of the waters of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Rauma came upon the night. Their brother and the
driver of their stolkjœrre joined them as they stood at
our tents, in the valley of the cascades, of wild scenery,
of all that was beautiful in nature. Much pleased they
seemed, as they listened to our gipsy song, and still
more pleased they appeared when we presented each
with a copy. We played for them several airs with our
guitar, violin, and tambourine. It was twelve o’clock
when they left to go on to Ormein for the night. We
had had a long day; as they left, I found that one of
the young ladies had presented Noah with a cigar-holder.
Soundly we slept, for we did not awake until eight
o’clock. One of our sea trout fried in buttered writing
paper was delicious for breakfast. We were just leaving,
at twelve o’clock, when a drayman came up, and we
gave him some brandy. He said an English gentleman
was coming to Ostersund to fish in the “Glommen,” in
August. The man said his son could speak English
very well. For some time he followed us along the
road, but at last we left him behind. The sun was
exceedingly hot when we reached Ormein.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> As we
approached the station the two young ladies rushed out.
One had two plates in her hand. They shook hands
with all of us, and we had a very warm welcome indeed.
Their brother brought some water for the donkeys. The
young traveller and his wife were also there. A very
enthusiastic reception we had. Miss S&mdash;&mdash;, said, she
had come there to meet a sister from Christiania. But
time presses, we must away; the comfortable station
must be left. With many adieux and godt reisen from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
young ladies, we ascended the hilly road from the station
and left the beautiful scenery which surrounds it.</p>

<p>Staying at our old camping-ground near the “Sœndre
Sletten fossen,” we had our mid-day meal&mdash;tea, fladbröd,
and butter. Noah and Zachariah played some music,
whilst Esmeralda had some instruction in dancing.
Between four and five o’clock our party were again <i>en
route</i> up the zig-zag hilly road, with Vand fos, rock, or
forest, continually in view.</p>

<p>At one point of the road a man, woman, and child
came running after us. They wished to see the donkeys.
Noah and Zachariah were far on before. The peasants’
countenances were marked with an expression of earnest
anxiety. The gipsies kept pushing on. Esmeralda said,
“We can’t stop for every gorgio,” and away ran the
man up the hill with his small boy tugging at his belt
behind, and the wife following, ready to sink for want
of breath. We came just in sight of our gipsies at a
turn of the road, and shouted, when they at last halted
very reluctantly.</p>

<p>The peasants, we were glad to see, reached them, but
nearly exhausted with haste and fatigue. Some more
people came from a house near, and brought some hay
for the donkeys. We were anxious for our peasant
friends to see the animals, and many were the questions
they asked. When we talked of winter they
seemed to shiver, and a shade of melancholy passed over
their countenances. After a halt of about ten minutes
we again continued our journey.</p>

<p>As we reached the summit of the hill near “Stueflaaten”
the clouds threatened rain. At Stueflaaten
station a delicate-looking woman with a stout child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
showed us into the guest-chamber. There were two
beds. The walls of the chamber were painted green and
red. Some photographs also adorned the room, which
was very clean, but to us the atmosphere was too close
to be pleasant. They procured for us some butter,
potatoes, and fladbröd, for which we paid three marks.
They gave us full value for our money. The evening
was wearing rapidly on as we left the station. Very soon
after we met a carriage and pair, in which sat a dark-eyed
traveller. His hair was jet black. Our gipsies had
to look sharp to get our donkeys in single file, and as we
brought up the rear with our alpenstock the traveller
scanned our party with much curiosity. Esmeralda paid
him the compliment afterwards of saying his hair was
as dark as any Romany’s.</p>

<p>It was getting late, as dusty and travel-worn we came
on to the open moorland by “Böver Möen.” This
time we camped near two or three broken firs, not very
far from the road, and near a hedge enclosing a thick
wood. Very shortly after our gipsies had unloaded our
things, and had lighted our fire, three fishermen, appeared
in the distance coming towards us. One was better
dressed than the others, and was the only wooden-legged
man we saw in Norway. He was stout and
portly. From his waistcoat he had suspended two small
trout, the result of his fishing expedition. Each had
some of our brandy-and-water, and drank to Gamle Norge.
Some boys came afterwards and brought some grass for
the donkeys. Then they watched our cooking with
interest. Whilst Esmeralda was getting the potatoes
ready, we fried some sea-trout in buttered writing-paper.
Very much surprised they seemed at the luxury of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
cuisine. Then Esmeralda fried some fish in the ordinary
way, and also some sliced potatoes. We enjoyed our tea on
that open moorland, in sight of a foaming waterfall down
the mountain-side by the Böverhö. Brandy-and-water
was handed round to those peasants assembled. Ourself
on guitar, and Zachariah with his violin, sitting as much
in the smoke of the fire as possible, on account of the
myriads of musketos, played lively airs, whilst Noah
was pitching the tents. Esmeralda was engaged putting
up the tea-things with every now and then a hearty denunciation
of the “migs” or musketos. Some young
peasant-girls came in time for the music. One, a
very modest, pretty girl, knitting a stocking, or a
strumper, as the gipsies called it. Another peasant-girl
brought us some milk, which she sold us for three
skillings. When our music was finished, and the peasants
had wished us good-night, we retired to rest. Rest
indeed for Zachariah. He was the smallest of the party,
and the mosketos with excellent generalship concentrated
their attacks upon the weakest point, when
Zachariah killed one, two were in its place. Wildly he
scratched, slapped, tumbled, and tossed, to his brother’s
disgust, who would say sharply, “Now then, can’t you
be quiet? Where are you getting your piro<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> (gip., foot)
to. Can’t you lie still, and let me go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Many readers may imagine that the brothers slept side
by side. They slept in true Romany fashion, that is, the
feet of each are placed on each side of the head, or under
the arms of the other. In this way a wonderful amount
of warmth is obtained. One blanket covered both, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
sometimes we might see in a morning Noah’s feet
sticking out on each side of Zachariah’s head.</p>

<p>The weather seemed inclined for rain the night before,
but the morning of Wednesday, 27th July, was delightful.
Noah was roused before six o’clock. To-day we should
be in the mountains. We heard Ole Rödsheim had
been at Stueflaaten. The trout Zachariah had caught
were fried for breakfast; four pounds of beef, the remainder
of what we had bought at Veblungsnœs was reluctantly
condemned as spoilt. The hot weather had
quite spoiled it. Some Norwegian girls came, and we
had three skillings’ worth of milk, and twelve skillings’
worth of stamped sweet fladbröd. Our donkeys were
nearly loaded about nine o’clock, when we saw Ole
Rödsheim stepping over the moorland. He did not
think we had arrived, but came to look out for us.
He scarcely expected we should manage the distance in
the time.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim had stayed the night at “Enebo.” As
we passed the house he took a cup of coffee, and we
soon after crossed the Enebo bridge, entered a beautiful
green lane, and left the main route before coming to
Molmen. It was delightful to find ourselves no longer
on the hard road.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim led the way from the lane by a track
through the open woodland. Now we come suddenly
upon a purling stream of water with deep holes, shaded
from the summer sun of the hot and sultry day. What
is this we see on the bank near a pool in the stream? A
heap of woman’s clothes; even her shoes; but where’s
the woman? Instinctively we looked into the quiet
pool formed by the stream, but no water-nymph was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
there. There was the clear gravelly bed which made us
wish to take a refreshing plunge.</p>

<p>The clothes were left. The woman was gone. Probably
wandering about in the forest. We hope she did
not unhappily lose herself. It is one of the mysteries
of this book we shall never be able to clear.</p>

<p>At one log châlet Ole Rödsheim took an old man with
us for a short distance. At another part of our winding
way up some open ground towards the woods, we could
see on the opposite side the valley sloping to the stream
below a man and woman running at the top of their
speed in the hot sun towards a bridge over the river.
Our party were fast ascending towards the ridge of the
ascent, and would soon be out of sight. Sometimes the
woman gained ground upon the man. Every muscle was
strained. It was the best steeplechase we ever saw.
Then they dashed wildly across a slight wooden bridge at
some distance off. We purposely delayed our cavalcade,
to let them have a chance, and panting for breath and
almost exhausted, they ultimately reached us. The admiration
they exhibited for the noble animals with which
we travelled left no doubt that they felt quite rewarded
for their long and well-contested race. We forget which
came up first.</p>

<p>Passing to the “Gröna elv,” above Molmen, we had
the opportunity of seeing the picturesque waterfall
called the Gröna fos. It roars through overhanging
rocks, and high above the Gröna we reached a slight
horse-bridge stretched over a wide deep chasm, with the
rapid waters of the river below. Very little attention
appears to be given to these bridges. The planks were
loose, and in places out, and some were not fastened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Stopping up the open places as well as our materials
would allow, we determined to risk our animals. They
fortunately went over the bridge exceedingly well, but
the last heavily laden donkey nearly slipped its hind leg
through an awkward crevice, and was only just saved.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim was very handy in our first experience
of Norwegian mountain-bridges, and quite verified our
early formed opinion of his quick readiness of resource.</p>

<p>Now we were winding through a forest of firs and birch.
Very warm it was, but the way was delightful. There
were two tracks to the Ny Sœter, but Ole chose the track
by a sœter, we believe called the Gröna Sœter.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> This we
reached in good time. The sœter is built on a wooded
plateau above a wild gorge through which the river
Gröna takes its course.

<p>No one was at the sœter. After a middags-mad of tea,
bacon, potatoes, fladbröd and butter, and a rest, we continued
our journey. After pursuing our rough mountain
track for a short time, we left the forest of the steep
mountain side, and commenced a toilsome ascent, in a
warm sun, across a wild rocky ravine, bare of trees, with
a stream running down it. It was not very deep. Our
party slowly ascended one side of the ravine towards the
higher slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p>Gradually Esmeralda and ourself, who were collecting
wild flowers, and Alpine Flora, were left behind.
Patches of snow rested here and there as we ascended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
the sides of the “Hyrjon Fjeld.” The open mountain
was rocky and bare of vegetation. Gradually and slowly
we ascended higher and higher, when we suddenly missed
our party. Track there was none distinguishable. We
ascended to some higher ridges; but could see nothing of
our guide, gipsies, or donkeys. A white handkerchief
was fastened to the end of our Alpenstock. We used
the shrill cry of the Australian signal and cooed loudly,
but could hear no signal in return. Not a vestige of
human life was to be seen on the rugged mountain slopes
around us. It was quite clear that somehow we were
lost. We had our compass; but then, we had no idea
as to the course across the mountains Ole Rödsheim proposed
to take.</p>

<p>Esmeralda did not appear much disconcerted by the
incident. It was a scene for the artist’s pencil, as the
gipsy-girl ascended a hillock strewn with loose grey rocks,
covered with lichen. There she stood in the evening
sun, in a distant land across the sea, the blue feathers of
her small straw hat, waving in the light warm breeze.
One could not help feeling, that there was something
more than common in this mystic race. The lone figure
of the gipsy-girl, whose home was nature, seemed the
queen of the wide expanse of barren “Fjeld” which she
then surveyed. She gave a whistle&mdash;that peculiar shrill
whistle which is known among themselves; a whistle,
which, if not heard quite at Christiania, certainly must
have disturbed the wild rein-deer of the surrounding
fjelds from their slumbers.</p>

<p>We had almost come to the conclusion that we might
have to spend the night as best we could on the “Hyrjon
Fjeld;” just then we heard a return signal across some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
ravines beyond us to our right. Zachariah had come back
in search. They had turned sharply across the mountain
slope to the right, and were hidden from view by the
intervening ravines. We raced across the mountain side,
and crossing some snow slopes of a ravine, getting well
ahead, we kept up a sharp and rapid fire of snowballs at
Esmeralda, prudently retreating immediately afterwards
in pursuit of our party.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>Noah and Ole Rödsheim were waiting. The donkeys
were soon in motion.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Noah, who had a great contempt for
botanical research; “That’s the way with Mr. Smith; he
plucks a flower, and then calls daughter to look at it.
She says it’s very pretty; and there they stand till
nobody can tell what has become of them.”</p>

<p>Poor Noah! botany was not his forte. But all was sunshine
again, and we quietly pursued our rough uneven
way.</p>

<p>Our path was now in the wild fjelds. Ole had his
peculiar landmarks. Sometimes it was a rock; sometimes
a large stone placed edgeways or on the top of
another. For some time we kept along the side of a
rugged slope. A large black and white eagle soared above
us with a hawk near it. It gave life to the scene. Soon
afterwards we came to an old reingrav. This is a kind
of pit or trap formed of loose stones, into which the reindeer
were sometimes driven by the hunters. A portion of
a reindeer’s horn was picked up by Noah and given to us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>Our way became more difficult. Each of the gipsies
had to lead their donkey. The ground was in places very
treacherous, and we often came to steep descents. The
Puru Rawnee, who was loaded much more heavily than the
other two, got her hind legs into very deep ground near
some rocks, and was with difficulty extricated. At some
distance beyond, in descending a slope, the Puru Rawnee
went right into a quicksand. We had to unload her,
and the ground being full of loose stones, we were afraid
she would cut her legs all to pieces. Noah was almost
despairing. It was his first experience of mountain work.</p>

<p>“What can we do, sir?” said he, in a melancholy
tone, “in such rough roads as these?”</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim came back to us, and we carried most of
the things some distance down to firmer ground. Again
loading, we started once more. Zachariah was as lively
as ever, with his donkey the Puro Rye, making short cuts,
and going now and then in advance, until warned to be
careful. We kept our course, until at last, crossing a
streamlet, in spite of every precaution, the Puru Rawnee
sank right into another quicksand, out of which we had
much difficulty in extricating her. The things had to be
taken off. We proposed camping out where we were;
for the donkeys, especially the Puru Rawnee, were getting
tired.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim suggested that there was better camping
ground on the other side a mountain ravine, a short distance
beyond. We decided to make a push for it, and
soon after succeeded in reaching a wide rocky ravine.
The stream was broken into many rivulets. The torrent’s
bed was strewn with loose rocks; so that with our tired
loaded animals, we crossed with difficulty, and winding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
round the foot of a lofty knowle above the ravine, we
entered a shallow gully at the back of it. Ascending a
gentle slope to the flat summit of the knowle, we found an
excellent camping ground.</p>

<p>The conical hill was just adapted for our tents. To our
right the waters of many streams issued from the large
snow-field we could see at a short distance up the ravine.
In front, at the foot of a long slope, and crossing the end
of the ravine, we could see the deep valley of the Gröna,
and above us the Skarvehöerne.</p>

<p>Our tents were soon pitched. Ole Rödsheim said he
should camp out if we could lend him a blanket. Our
fire was lighted, and we shared with him our tea, eggs,
fladbröd, and butter. Esmeralda lay on the ground near
the camp-fire, and could not take anything. She was
taken very unwell. She wished to be left in peace, and
to Noah, who asked her again, she said “No!” so sharply
that he quickly left her.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim went to make his bed under a rock on
the side of the gully below us. His little wallet, and
small brass camp-kettle in it, were left by our smouldering
fire. Almost immediately after down came torrents of
rain. We had just time to seize our waterproof rug
which we slept on, and our guide’s wallet. Our first
thought was for him. He had just formed a sort of
nest like a coffin with loose stones, the lower part covered
over by flat stones stuffed with loose heath and stunted
birch. In an instant he was stretched in his form.
Throwing the waterproof over him, we gave him his
wallet underneath, and left him for the night. There was
one satisfaction, our guide would be perfectly dry if not
particularly warm in his mountain quarters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>Returning to the tents in pouring rain, we unfolded
our waterproof, and placed it over the tents, for the
moisture was already making its way through our
blanket covering. Esmeralda had crawled in, and was
lying in a very helpless state. We had to move her, whilst
we made her bed, and packed her up comfortable for
the night. She might be bilious from the middags-mad
of potatoes and bacon; but she said afterwards it was
owing to a sudden chill when she ate some snow, or from
her wet feet. Giving her some brandy the last thing,
for she did not know how she felt, we hoped our universal
panacea would effect a cure.</p>

<p>Just before going to bed, the rain ceased; and going
to Ole, a voice under the waterproof said he was
very comfortable. As we were going into our tents,
we could not help gazing on the magnificent sea
of white mist rising from the deep valley of the Gröna
below.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>Soon after five o’clock we were up, and descending in
a thick mist to the ravine, we had a good wash. The
donkeys were inspected, and their legs carefully rubbed
down with our bruise mixture, which was an universal
remedy for all cuts, bruises, aches, and pains. Ole was
apparently sleeping soundly, and we did not disturb
him. Our gipsies got up, and at six o’clock Ole was
moving and none the worse for his rough accommodation.
He had, I believe, been up before to see if the donkeys
were safe. Everything was wet, and no fuel could be
found but one or two damp sticks from the ravine, and
the roots of heath and dwarf birch. A fire seemed
hopeless, but our Russian lamp overcame all difficulty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
and we soon had a fire. Tea and fladbröd and butter
formed our breakfast.</p>

<p>Whilst we were leading our donkeys, a pale, large-boned
peasant appeared. No one knew from whence,
but he was able to quaff some of our brandy. Esmeralda
was again tolerably well. As Ole proceeded in advance,
and we were ascending the right slope of the ravine, he
shouted&mdash;“Ah, Mr. Smith! you have no hotel bills to
settle, sir.” Ole seemed to have taken a deep interest in
our mode of life.</p>

<p>Our ascent up rocky slopes was laborious and heavy.
The Digervarden Fjeld on our left, and the Grönhöerne
on our right. In the distance was the Skarvdalseggen
and the Digerkampen. With even pace we followed our
rough stony track, often near slopes of snow. All nature
was as desolate and sterile as could well be imagined.
Although lightened of its load, our Puru Rawnee had
still a heavy weight. It was necessary to be very careful
as to boggy ground. At one place, notwithstanding all
care, she was effectually bogged in a deep quagmire, and
with difficulty pulled out. Crossing a sterile ridge of loose
gray rocks, Ole suggested we should try some large
snow slopes as easier, which we did. Sometimes where
the snow was not deep we managed very well, and passed
over slopes of smooth frozen snow glittering in the sun.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as we again came to the rocks, the snow
was deep, and we found ourselves for a few feet plunging
with our donkeys above our knees in snow, and the
loaded animals could scarcely get through. Again we
were picking our way over loose rocks, with occasional
reaches of frozen snow to cross. Our journey was toilsome.
The upper portions of our route were sterile and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
dreary, without that abrupt boldness of outline which
gives an interest to the scene. As we commenced our descent
to the valley of the Lora Elv, to reach the Ny Sœter,
we had to descend a very rough mountain track, difficult
for our already tired donkeys. Still we were anxious to
reach the Ny Sœter before we called a halt. At last,
at an awkward place, the Puru Rawnee fell, and, in
trying to recover itself, again fell, with its head doubled
under its body. The whole weight of the packs slipped
forward upon it. As it rolled over and lay motionless,
we thought our beautiful Puru Rawnee had broken its
neck. Quickly getting the baggage away, we let it lie
quiet. After some short time, it seemed to recover, and
got up. Ole Rödsheim shouldered our fishing rods and
some heavy packs. Each took something to lighten
materially our gray donkey, and, walking quickly down
past an old reindeer grav,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> we soon reached several small
log-houses, near a brawling snow stream, called the Lora
Elv. We had arrived at the Ny Sœter.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>Near the Ny Sœter there was a fenced paddock, and
close to the Sœter a sheltered flat of turf, where we unloaded
and pitched our tents. Our day’s journey had
taken us from half-past nine o’clock till four o’clock. The
Lordalen, as it is called, is now almost bare of trees, cold,
and uninteresting in appearance even in the height of the
summer season. The rage for cutting down the forests
in Norway will render the country in some parts almost
uninhabitable. In Wales the climate would be warmer,
and the mountains more picturesque, and the country
far more beautiful, if still clothed with its ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
forests; but Norway can never be used for sheep pasture,
as the hills of Wales, on account of the climate;
and the forests for shelter are still more necessary in the
northern clime.</p>

<p>Middagsmad consisted of tea, ham, potatoes, and
pickled walnuts. Ourself, Noah, and Zachariah went
fishing; but, not meeting with any sport, we soon
returned with Noah. The peasants at the Sœter were
very kind, civil people. They were all women and
children, one being a boy. One very nice little girl
hummed very prettily several Norwegian airs for us.
The wind blew cold in the evening. Zachariah came
back to tea, with two trout. For our aftensmad we had
Zachariah’s two trout, with fladbröd and butter from the
Sœter. Esmeralda was very bilious; could not finish
her tea; said she could not touch tea again; was unwell.
The tea, she said, was not good, or the fladbröd. Her
brother Noah said she ate too fast, and so made herself
unwell; for, said Noah, the tea is excellent. Our gipsies
would now and then wrangle and chaff, till a stranger
would suppose they were going to fight, as on this
evening.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Lucas, don’t tell lies. Dawdy. There’s
a state he puts himself in, the ballo shero!”</p>

<p>“Dik the Bongy Mouee!” exclaimed another. “Sheep’s
eyes! ah, you talk backwards, like Amy, you do!”</p>

<p>Then Esmeralda would say satirically, “Well indeed,
so manly! Doesn’t he put himself over every one,
Ambrose does.”</p>

<p>“What is daughter saying?” answers Noah. “Blankesko!
look at Ezekiel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say so,” shouted Zachariah.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Smith whether it is a lie. Oh, yes; Ambrose
can do anything, he can.”</p>

<p>It was, however, satisfactory to know that in a few
minutes they did not trouble themselves about their
hastily expressed opinions of one another.</p>

<p>Our gipsies were shortly afterwards singing, “Gamle
Norge,” humming a tune, or arranging our things with a
merry laugh. Poor Mr. Rödsheim was sorely puzzled at
the variety of names they seemed to possess; but at last
Noah settled down into Mr. Ambrose, Esmeralda into
Miss Daughter, and Zachariah into Master Zâkēē.</p>

<p>In the evening, as the Sœter girl collected her cows,
there was something charming in her peculiar call. The
high modulated pitch of the voice&mdash;tones at once plaintive
and persuasive, seemed to lure the animals to her
from the far distance. It was nine o’clock when we sang
our gipsy song for them, and then ourself, Noah, and
Zachariah sat by the fire playing the guitar, violin, and
tambourine, as the young girls danced on the level green
till ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim slept in state that night&mdash;the Englishman’s
house was placed at his disposal. This log-house
appeared to have been built for sportsmen, and had been
occupied by English gentlemen, in 1869, for reindeer
shooting; but on these fjelds, we were told, the reindeer
were now scarce, and the rype not plentiful.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>Ole was stirring in good time. Eggs for breakfast,
with tea, fladbröd, and butter, from the Sœter, for which
we paid two marks, twelve skillings. Ole Rödsheim,
who at first was scarcely inclined to touch tea, as he
usually drank coffee, now seemed getting quite fond of
it. One English gentleman to whom he had been guide,
seems to have been equally fond of brandy. It was
during forest travel in Australia that we first acquired
the habit of taking tea with each meal. It is the custom
in the Bush; and, as regards ourselves, we have found it
sufficient stimulus for every kind of exposure and hard
mountain work.</p>

<p>At breakfast, the women of the Sœter brought us a present
of some milk, and Esmeralda a cake of best fladbröd,
with clotted cream upon it&mdash;very different hospitality
from our host at Veblungsnœs. It was excellent; but we
think added slightly to the biliousness of Esmeralda.
Then they brought us more cake and clotted cream; but
we were obliged to beg off and get Ole Rödsheim to
explain that we had really had quite sufficient.</p>

<p>The woman took us to see the Englishman’s house. It
was very clean; but bare of furniture. The Englishmen,
who were evidently of lively temperament, appear to have
stayed there some time. As a change from hard life in
the fjelds, a Norwegian musician would occasionally
come, and the Sœter girls from the district assemble for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
a dance on the level green. Their names were recorded
inside the door of the Englishman’s wooden house as
follows:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Giving the woman’s son a present of some fishing flies,
which he wanted, and the woman a large tin water-can
which we managed to spare, our party left about ten
o’clock. The first difficulty was a bridge, but after much
trouble we got the donkeys over, and ascended the
mountain slope of the valley through the few scattered
birch trees which were left.</p>

<p>The track was not beset with much difficulty, and,
ascending the high lands of the Fillingshö Fjeld, we had
the Skardstind and Kjölen Fjeldene on our left, and
the Jehanshö Fjeld on our right. We were now
in the Gudbransdalen. Traversing wild open moorlands,
with scarcely any vegetation, we halted about
two o’clock by a small streamlet, on the open mountain.
A few sticks we had collected on our way
enabled us to make our fire. Tea and fladbröd and
butter formed our meal. The fladbröd was not of the
best description. Zachariah called it bearskin, but after
all it was palatable to a mountaineer, and we bid him be
satisfied he did not fare worse; it was nearly all consumed
at this meal, to Zachariah’s intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>We were soon ready for a start. The animals had
rested; the Puru Rawnee did not seem much the worse for
its fall the day before. It is not well to keep them <i>en
route</i> more than four hours without a rest. The Puru
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Rawnee’s back was slightly sore, and we adopted the plan
of folding the tent cover into two rolls, and placing
one on each side its back, so as to relieve all pressure.
This plan answered exceedingly well.</p>

<p>Leaving about four o’clock, we passed near the Aur
Vand, or, as it is marked in one map, the Horgven Lake.
It is a large lake, and Ole said it was celebrated for its
fish. As we continued our way down a very steep mountain
track, descending towards Skeaker, the Lomseggen
came in view, and snowy hills on our right. On one side
we had the Bipsberg, and the other the Loms Horungen.</p>

<p>Zachariah, who had ridden with the packs on his donkey
along the undulating plateaux, had now to dismount.
Each had to go to the donkey’s head; the track was precipitous
on the side of a deep ravine.

<p>Noah broke his alpenstock. Descending still lower,
we saw a waterfall formed by the stream from the lake.
In a large extent of wood, on the other side, numbers of
firs, which had once formed a picturesque shelter, had
been cut down, and were lying on the ground. The
owner, a well-to-do farmer, had yielded to the solicitations
of a timber-merchant, and had cut down much of
his wood. The timber-merchant, after buying and
taking some of the best, found it was not worth his while
to remove the remainder of the trees, owing to the roughness
of the stream down which he intended to float them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
The timber was therefore lying as we saw it, probably to
be used as firewood.</p>

<p>By a short cut we descended down a very steep bank,
with our animals and baggage, to the level road to
Skeaker. The road was an extremely narrow lane, with
a wooden fence on both sides; fields of grain were improved
in luxuriance by irrigation. At one place we saw
a peasant throwing water over his grain with a wooden
shovel. The peasants seemed well-to-do. The farms
on each side the road were numerous, but small in
size.</p>

<p>Then we had the usual rush to see the donkeys, and
an occasional meeting in the narrow lane with ponies,
who obstinately refused to fraternise with our cavalcade.</p>

<p>At last, after passing a large well-built wooden house,
with a stuffed owl on the summer-house of its garden,
we crossed a bridge over the Otta Elv.</p>

<p>Our camp was selected on a large open common, under
the shelter of a wooden fence, not very far from the road.
Ole went to a farm-house for provisions, and to say we
had camped there. The tents were soon pitched, a fire
lighted, and we had tea and eggs in our tents. The
gipsies were very lively; the day’s exertions had quite
cured Esmeralda.</p>

<p>Numbers of peasants came in groups toward the camp.
One man, dressed in black with a slouched hat, was the
most solemn-looking individual we ever saw. The gipsies
called him Uncle Elijah; another was styled Ezekiel.
Ole said there were some peasants who did not like music
or dancing.</p>

<p>The numbers increased, and they thronged round with
eager curiosity. We were thankful that Ole was now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
showman; no doubt, with much ingenuity, Ole made
many difficult explanations. Our guide was quite equal
to the task.</p>

<p>The donkeys were ever surrounded by anxious visitors.
One very pretty girl came up, as we were standing at the
tent entrance; speaking English with a strong American
accent, she said, “And where do you live?”</p>

<p>Our answer that we occasionally resided in London,
seemed a sufficient address, for she continued, “Are you
married?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said we, with a tone of much melancholy.</p>

<p>Then she told us she had been in America and England;
that she liked England better than Norway. She
said she wanted to get married, and stayed in Norway to
be with her mother. Her brother had sold the large
house and farm, on the other side the river, to the
government for 6,300 dollars. For some time we conversed
together.</p>

<p>After the pretty Norwegian had left, we went to sit in
our tent. As we entered, Esmeralda drew herself up
with much dignity. A storm was coming&mdash;indications
of the hurricane appeared on the surface of her dark
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“The Rye had better have his Norwegian Rackly at
once! She’ll keep your tents for you! Didn’t you hear
how they rocker’d together, Noah?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Noah, in secret enjoyment of his sister’s
indignation, “the Rye did say something about marriage,
when she axed him.”</p>

<p>“Won’t she see after the Rye’s things?” exclaimed
Esmeralda, more and more indignant.</p>

<p>“Dawdy! dawdy!” said Zachariah, in his blandest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
accents, as he sat on the ground and quietly rubbed his
hands, swaying to and fro, whilst his dark eyes sparkled
with malicious fire. “Dawdy! dawdy! but the Rye
can tice it on with the girls, can’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Tice it on,” answered Esmeralda; “I’m not to be
deceived. Noah, let’s be a gellin.”</p>

<p>There was an expressive tinge of indignant melancholy
as Esmeralda said this. Our position was
like the mariner in a heavy sea. After all, we really
had no desire to change our hobbenengree, Esmeralda,
who had travelled with us so many miles, and shared with
us so many fatigues. Why should we change? Why
should not Noah ask the pretty Norwegian girl in marriage?
Indeed, we at once undertook to carry out the
delicate mission. The question should be asked when
she came. Noah was not unwilling.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Esmeralda said, “Dawdy! There’s
a scheme of the Rye’s,” she was evidently more at ease,
and in a few minutes we were playing some of our gipsy
and other tunes, nor did we forget the “gipsy hornpipe,”
the favourite air of our gipsies’ ancient grandmother, who
had recently died at some incredible age, after giving
to the world seventeen children.</p>

<p>The number of our visitors increased. Seated in our
tents, we played a variety of airs. Some few danced on
the greensward near; many tried to get a view of us by
looking over the baulk between our tents. Ole was the
centre of many a circle, as the peasants grouped round
him, asking him all sorts of questions.</p>

<p>At length the push and pressure was so great our tents
were in danger of being levelled with the ground. In vain
Esmeralda became impatient and remonstrated, still the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
peasants, anxious to see us, crowded against the tents and
baulk.</p>

<p>Well we remember the tall active form of the gipsy
girl, rising suddenly from the ground. Never shall we
forget the amazon of our tents, the wild spirit of our
many wanderings, seizing Noah’s broken alpenstock.
We were reminded of

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the last words of Marmion!<br /></span>
</span></span>

as she went forth. There was a sudden withdrawal of
pressure from our tents; there was a tramp of feet, a
hurried stampede of short duration. Whether Uncle
Elijah was knocked down, or what became of Ezekiel we
never knew. We did not go out to pick up the wounded.
Probably their bodies, like that of King James II., at the
battle of Flodden, were never discovered. They did not
appear the next morning. We mourned them as amongst
the slain. Flushed and heated from the fray, Esmeralda
soon returned. Our music continued till closing eve
warned us it was time for rest. The peasants wished us
good-night, and departed.</p>

<p>Yet once more before they all departed we held converse
with the very pretty girl of Skeaker. Esmeralda
had the satisfaction of hearing us propose for Noah. Our
visitor did not appear altogether adverse, but we fear our
advocacy was feeble, for nothing ultimately came of it,
and we retired to rest.</p>

<p>We mused lightly upon the novelty and charm of our
wild wandering life as we rose at six o’clock. Ole Rödsheim
procured us eggs for breakfast. Fire was lighted;
Zachariah tried the river for fish. In vain we sought a
spot sufficiently private for matutinal ablutions; the river
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
banks were almost level with the water’s edge; our camp
was almost on an island. We afterwards retired beneath
the arch of the second bridge, where we had all the
seclusion of a private boudoir.</p>

<p>As we appeared on the bridge, refreshed and braced up
for the day’s exertion, to our surprise we again met the
pretty girl of Skeaker. She had a young companion with
her. Her American accent seemed now to give us pleasure,
and then she spoke English very well. As we
exchanged greetings chance caused us to look towards
the river; the tall slim form of our hobbenengree (gip.
housekeeper) was standing by the water’s edge, looking
towards us. Her dark flashing eyes followed every
movement.</p>

<p>As we slowly returned to the tents we expected
another storm, but Esmeralda waited till she was
gone. “I saw it all,” said Esmeralda, somewhat reproachfully.
“How artfully the Rackly waited till
you were on the bridge; but never mind, you can
take her.”</p>

<p>It was difficult to convince her that Noah’s suit required
several interviews and much pressing solicitation.</p>

<p>Our camp ground was delightful; several visitors
came to our camp. Noah was leading the donkeys for
our departure. Then we soon perceived our pretty
Norwegian friend who spoke English; she had one or
two young ladies with her.</p>

<p>Whilst Ole Rödsheim gave Noah some assistance, I
proposed to give our visitors a few parting tunes; in
fact, they were anxious to hear us play once more.</p>

<p>Esmeralda looked in no lively mood towards her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
supposed rival. She would not play for the gorgios.
Taking our guitar, we sat down, and, accompanied by
Zachariah on his violin, we gave them some farewell
music.</p>

<p>All is ready. The morning is beautiful. About ten
o’clock the word was given to start. Ole formed our
advance guard, and led the way, staff in hand, some
distance a-head. By some shuffle in the cards of fate,
Esmeralda was in the rear guard as we bowed farewell to
our friendly visitors, and especially to the long-to-be-remembered
pretty girl of Skeaker.</p>

<p>Our party quietly followed the narrow road along the
right shore of the beautiful “Otta Vand.” The road was
very narrow, and fenced in. Comfortable homesteads of
the peasant farmers were delightfully placed between the
road and the lake. We remarked their substantial, and
well-to-do appearance. This seemed one of the most
fertile districts we had yet traversed.</p>

<p>Crossing the “Sand Aa” (Nor. sandy rivulet) we
gradually approached Lom, which is about six or seven
English miles from Skeaker. Some of the farm houses
built on promontories, stretching from the shores of the
lake, have names terminating in “næs” (Nor. point), as
for instance, Studnæs (rough point), and many others.
At a farm called Sundtnæs, we bought twenty-five eggs
for one mark five skillings. Our expenses at Skeaker,
including butter, eighteen eggs, and fladbröd, amounted
to three marks.</p>

<p>On our way from Skeaker, Esmeralda soon recovered
her wonted spirits, and said quietly, she hoped we
would not think anything of what she had said; she
did not mean it; was it likely we should have anyone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
else to look after our things. It is wonderful how
soon the heart inclines itself to forgive; yet in after
days now, and by chance, a quiet allusion to the pretty
girl of Skeaker produced its effect on our suspicious
hobbenengree.

SNOW&mdash;THE SUNRISE.</p>

<p>Zachariah, the Mephistopheles of our party, desiring
probably to afford more varied incident for our “impressions
de voyage” declared war upon a wasps’ nest.</p>

<p>Although warned, but too late, he took a hasty shot
with a stone at the nest, artistically constructed, on a
bough, hanging on the road side.</p>

<p>What business had we to quarrel with these paper
makers, who knew their art long before man had emerged
from his pre-historic condition? why needlessly destroy
their curious homestead? but the stone had gone upon its
mission.</p>

<p>Zachariah soon became acquainted with the “lex
talionis” of the invaded colony; strange to say, the wasps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
directed their attack only on himself. He was singled out
as the aggressor, and a sharp sudden sting, under one eye,
entirely ruined his personal appearance for the morning.</p>

<p>We arrived at Lom about mid-day. Ole went in
advance to see the Prœsten Halling. As we approached
a large open expanse of meadow land, open to the junction
of roads, from Skeaker, Vaage and Rödsheim we saw
the church, which picturesquely stands near the lake.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
Near it, the charming manse of the Prœsten Halling. A
large wooden structure near the road, we were told, had
been used formerly as a granary to store the grain, paid
as tithe, to the clergyman of the parish. This payment
is now, we believe, made in money. As we looked upon
the church and parsonage, surrounded as they were, by
the meadow park, with the broad silver lake near, the
rising mountains on all sides, and the clear blue sky
above, our senses seemed entranced with the passing
beauty of the scene; it was one of those chance glimpses
of perfect nature, which cast their anchor deep in memory,
and leave a lasting impression of bygone days.</p>

<p>That the Prœsten was in harmony with so much that
was pleasing, we did not doubt, and when he came to
meet us accompanied by our guide, he warmly welcomed
our gipsy party; he would have us enter beneath his
roof, and accept his kindly hospitality; we did not value
the proffered hospitality the less, though we did not
accept it. Ours was a life of travel in the fresh air of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
heaven; air that myriads are dying for every day. It is
as essential to man as water is to fish. The delightful
shade of some trees near the road, a short distance from
the parsonage, tempted us; there we halted, and there,
reluctantly, the Prœsten allowed us to remain. After
strolling with him for a short time along the pleasant
walks of his grounds, he left us to take our mid-day meal;
we enjoyed it in our own gipsy fashion; our meal consisted
of fried bacon, fladbröd and tea. Ole obtained our
letters and newspapers from the Loms Postaabneri. We
had telegraphed our correspondence from Kongsberg;
the packet was large, and cost us three dollars and forty-four
skillings. Our newspapers which had been sent to
Bergen, we left to their fate; the “Illustrated London
News” seemed to please the Prœsten Halling, and his
family. When our mid-day meal was concluded, Prœsten
Halling, Mrs. Halling, three young ladies, her sisters, a
brother, and two gentlemen staying with Mr. Halling,
came to see us; They were much interested with our
gipsies; Zachariah’s swollen face had unfortunately marred
his beauty, Noah had unfortunately taken some offence
at his sister Esmeralda. Noah’s temper was to blame;
occasionally an interchange of Romany and English
terms flashed between them.</p>

<p>We had wished our gipsies to appear to the best advantage.
One with a swollen eye and two at cross
purposes had a jarring effect on our nervous system,
nevertheless, our visitors seemed interested with them.
We trust they made allowance for the wildness of their
nature. We can assure them, Zachariah had not always
a swollen eye, and Noah was rarely out of temper;
even our hobbenengree had her moments of sudden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
sunshine, delightful after previous storms, and the
fitful passions of her gipsy soul. All was harmony
after we had commenced our music&mdash;guitar, violin, and
tambourine. We sang for our visitors the gipsy song,
and gave the Prœsten Halling a copy of it, as a parting
souvenir; the ladies, and some of the gentlemen, sang
several Norwegian melodies for us. They had good
voices; “over the high fjeld” was a beautiful song, and
seemed appropriate to our parting. Some charming Norwegian
songs are written by Björnsen. Very pleasantly
passed our mid-day halt, with the Prœsten Halling and his
family. Wide spread, we afterwards found, was the fame
of the Prœsten Halling<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> for his kindly heart, his true
christian feeling, and invariable hospitality to travellers.
Speaking English perfectly, we were told he had officially,
much and active ministration, among the English navvies
employed, during the construction of the Railway from
Christiania.</p>

<p>Our donkeys were again loaded. The Puru Rawnee
had a chafed back, but by careful folding of our tent-cover,
we prevented pressure upon it; sore backs are
always difficult to prevent in crossing a mountainous
country. We had reached Lom about twelve o’clock, and
left about four. Our gipsies were ready; we bade all
farewell, perhaps never to meet again, but not the less to
be held in our pleasing remembrance.</p>

<p>The evening was very warm; indeed, as we slowly
followed the road up the “Bœverdal Elv,” we found it
exceedingly hot. It is about nine miles distance from
Lom to Rödsheim; comfortable homesteads met our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
view as we passed along. The usual excitement to see our
donkeys was here and there met with. It is said there
are four hundred farms in the parish of Lom, and every
tenth man had lately emigrated, but no inconvenience
had been felt by the diminution of population.</p>

<p>Not far along the road, we met a young Norwegian
student <i>en route</i> towards Lom. Ole conversed with him.
He was dressed in light tourist costume, and high lace-up
boots, and had attempted alone the ascent of the Galdhöpiggen.
The student had failed, and was returning with
all the weight of disappointed ambition upon his mind.
Ole had predicted the failure. Well we remembered our
similar fate in former years, when we ourselves, and
several fellow-tourists, headed by the celebrated mountaineer,
poor Hudson, returned from an attempted ascent
of Mont Blanc. Tired, wayworn, torn, and jaded, and,
worse, disappointed, we reached the picturesque Hotel
Mont Joli at Saint Gervais only to try again with better
success.</p>

<p>Ole, anxious to reach Rödsheim as soon as possible,
went on in advance. We saw him again, when he had
reached his father’s farm near the road side. Ole and his
father were just going to start for Rödsheim in a stolkjœrre.
His services were unnecessary as guide to Rödsheim.
It was useless for Ole to remain with us. They
wished us much to go with them in the stolkjœrre, and
leave our gipsies and donkeys to follow after.</p>

<p>Ole’s father was a fine, hale, strong old man, and his
wife a comely stout woman. We preferred to remain
with our gipsies and baggage, feeling a sort of independence
of all kinds of lifts. Possessing good health and
spirits, we felt no fatigue from our daily exertion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Exposure to the fresh air seemed to give us an enduring
strength quite beyond the requirement of stimulant
or the necessity for artificial locomotion.</p>

<p>It was now determined to push on after Ole Rödsheim
as rapidly as we could. Zachariah was mounted on the
top of the baggage on the Pure Rye. Noah took the lead
on foot in care of the Puru Rawnee and Puro Rye.
Esmeralda, who, was tired, we mounted on the baggage of
her Merle, the Tarno Rye, and brought up the rear. The
road was tolerably level and we proceeded along at a
sharp pace. Every turn of the valley brought us in view
of fresh scenes to admire.</p>

<p>Passing a wicket on the road side, we caught sight of
two young artists in the garden of a small cottage. Their
canvas was upon an easel. One was then painting a
scene from nature. They were apparently taking a bend
of the valley down which the glacier-coloured waters of
Bœver Elv<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> dashed its wild course. The maisonette
was so homely, the point of View so picturesque, we
could not help pausing. Quickly calling a halt we exchanged
salutations with them. They were both very
good looking young fellows. The one, we were informed
afterwards, was considered the handsomest man in Norway.
He was certainly exceedingly handsome, though
a trifle too effeminate for a man; yet there was much to
admire in the form and expression of the countenance.
They accepted an offer of some aquavit to drink “gamle
norge.” Our flask was brought into requisition. Somehow
the brandy seemed rather muddy, both in flask and
bottle newly opened. Noah accounted for it by saying
that when the old man at Veblungsnœs sold it to him, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
brandy was nearly out of the cask, which had to be lifted
up, before he could fill the bottles. A passing suspicion
crossed our mind that it may have been caused by the
addition of water, but still we did not like to suspect any
one of our party. Be that as it may, the artists both
quaffed off a small tumbler each without even winking
their eyes. With a hasty farewell, we continued our
road, pushing on at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>As evening fell, and we gradually lost the heat of
the sun, there was a refreshing coolness in Bœverdalen.
On our right the lofty heights of the Lomseggen Fjeld,
extending from Lom, rose above us; on our left the
Bœver Elv was ever near the road,&mdash;at times wide,
broad, and broken into many rough and shallow rapids.
Our party was not out of place in such picturesque
scenes. The two leading merles, loaded with various
baggage, tent raniers, and camp appliances, including
Zachariah, the Mephistopheles of our party, mounted on
one, were followed by the tall, lank, muscular form of
Noah. He combined the appearance of the smuggler,
brigand, the chamois hunter, and gipsy. Noah was the
beau ideal of the “genus homo,” as we see them depicted
according to the conventional rules of art. At a short distance
behind, as a sort of rear guard, Esmeralda was
mounted on the miscellaneous baggage of the Tarno Rye,
with ourselves near. How lively and happy the hobbenengree
seemed! Bronzed by exposure to the hot
Norwegian suns, hardened by rough spare diet and continued
travel through all weathers, ours was indeed a life
of health, freedom, and pleasure.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock we came in sight of Rödsheim. It
is a substantial wooden house, with capacious out-buildings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
near an excellent mountain road. The house
stands at the foot of a rocky hill at the head of an ascent
where the valley becomes narrow. On the other side the
road, close to the house, the Bœver Elv dashes through
a deep cleft of narrow gorge in the rocks. There is no
fishing in the glacier water of the river. The house at
Rödsheim was very clean and well ventilated. Ole well
knew the English penchant, especially of the mountain
tourist. The comfortable guest chamber of his house
had always its open window, with pleasant View down
the valley.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> was ready to receive us. He pointed
out a convenient camping ground a short distance beyond
the house, just below the road, close upon the edge of the
precipice of the ravine. It suited us exactly. Ole knew
it. He had not been camping with us some days without
knowing the foibles of our heart.</p>

<p>“There’s the spot for the Herre.”</p>

<p>Ole was quite right; and the roaring waters of
Bœverdal Elv in the stillness of that night hushed our
party to sleep. Our tents were quickly pitched by our
gipsies. The pige from the house brought us firewood.
We had eggs, bread and butter, and tea, for our evening’s
meal. Ole Rödsheim brought out a bottle of his home-brewed
beer. We had one glass each, for we shared
everything with our party. It was excellent beer. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
we went to the house, and made acquaintance with Mrs.
Rödsheim, a quiet, pale, industrious helpmate. She
appeared an excellent housewife. After a chat with Ole,
we returned to our camp. Our music enlivened the quiet
valley before we retired to rest.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles was in sad tribulation. May it be
recorded, that the evening before, the hat from Christy’s
of London, purchased in Norway, which had cost us one
dollar, was blown into the ravine, and had disappeared.
It was an occurrence which could not long be concealed.
The hat must be produced some time, or accounted for.
We certainly were annoyed when he confessed the fact.
Something was said about the owner going to Christiania
without one. Ultimately the Rye relented. Ole Rödsheim
lent Zachariah a cloth military-looking cap, which
was afterwards purchased second-hand for less than half
the price of the hat lost.</p>

<p>Sunday morning at Rödsheim. We were up in good
time. How we enjoyed our breakfast in the rocks at the
edge of the deep ravine. The day was very hot. It was
the last day of July. Most of the peasants would be
actively engaged next month in their harvests. Ole came
occasionally to see that we had everything we wished.
Once Ole said, in a melancholy tone, he wished to speak
with me aside. We went with him away from the tents,
and he placed in our hands a blacked-edged letter, saying
it might contain bad news, and we might wish to be
alone when we received it. Fortunately, the emblem
of mourning referred to past events already known.
Yet we did not think the less of Ole’s kind thought.
Some peasants came to see our camp and the donkeys.
All was quietude and peace at Rödsheim.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>One of the points to be attained in our line of travel,
was the ascent of the highest mountain in Norway, the
Galdhöpiggen, or pike of Galdhö. Who Galdhö was we
could not ascertain.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Although we were unsuccessful in
obtaining the origin of the name, we determined, if possible,
to make the ascent of this mountain.</p>

<p>It was arranged that we should start at nine o’clock at
night, Ole, ourself, and Noah, for the expedition. Esmeralda
and Zachariah to be left in care of the tents.</p>

<p>At mid-day we had ham, eggs, and potatoes for dinner,
close to our camp. On the edge of the ravine stood a small
log-hut used as a blacksmith’s shop. Since our kettle
prop had been lost, we had substituted two Alpine stocks
with a wire between them for boiling our water for tea.
It was a clumsy substitute, which necessity imposed upon
us. Ole now arranged that a blacksmith should make
us another prop before we left Rödsheim.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock Ole was ready, and ourself and Noah
were each armed with an Alpine stock. Each took a
small supply of bread and goat’s cheese. Making our adieu
to Esmeralda and Zachariah, we were soon <i>en route</i> up
the valley.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded far when a farm servant from
Rödsheim overtook us, and said that two English gentlemen
required Ole’s presence as guide. They were certainly
unfortunate; the expedition had commenced, and Ole
sent back a message of excuse.</p>

<p>Ole soon afterwards left the main road. Entering a
thick wood to our left in Indian file, we ascended a steep
winding foot path, until an open plateau was reached.
Very shortly afterwards we reached the “Rödberg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Sœter.” Ole knocked at the door, and obtained a rope
from the woman. It was exactly half-past ten o’clock.
Walking over some undulating turf ground we soon
afterwards commenced another steep ascent. The slope
was covered with loose stones, scattered on all sides. It
was quite dusk, and deliciously cool after the heat of the
day. At half-past eleven Ole called a halt, and we had
a slight repast of bread and cheese and cold tea.</p>

<p>Again we were <i>en route</i>, still walking in Indian file,
and soon reached another long narrow plateau. Over
loose rocks, in the dim light, we picked our way as we
could for some distance. The Dögurdsmaals Kampen, a
steep sharp mountain, rose above us. We at length
skirted the glacier lake of the Gjuvbrœen. In this lake
we were told by Ole, the Herre Watson, the tourist of
tourists, once bathed. Ole evidently considered our
countryman one of the best mountaineers he had seen.
It must have been a cold plunge; but what is there that
an Englishman will not undertake? If we had passed it
at mid-day the example may have been followed.</p>

<p>The long reach of stones, whose angular points made
it necessary to keep a sharp look-out at every step, were
at last exchanged for a gentle slope of tolerably hard level
snow. It was a great relief, after the rough pathway of
stones just left. A false step on such an irregular causeway
involves a broken leg, a grazed shin, or at least a
sprained ankle.</p>

<p>At last we reached the edge of a broad but at this
point tolerably level glacier, across which we could in the
dimness of the night see the dome of the Galdhöpiggen
rising beyond. Its summit, a dome of hard frozen snow,
rests against a precipice of rocks, above which it rises
some feet. From the small nearly flat space, which forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
the head of the Galdhöpiggen, the frozen snow immediately
slopes off at an angle of from 40 to 50 degrees,
and joins the glaciers in the far distance below. It was
a wild and desolate scene, as we sat on some broken
rocks. Another precipice rose to our right, as if to test
supremacy with the Galdhöpiggen in this region of eternal
snow. After some slight refreshment we roped ourselves
together. No great difficulty presented itself as we
crossed the glacier to the rocks which formed an arrête
to the snow dome of the Galdhöpiggen. Once or twice
Noah sank up to his middle, but the crevasses were
narrow and easily crossed. Very easy work to one who
had crossed the Glacier des Bossons.</p>

<p>Then commenced the ascent of the steep arrête of rocks,
but even these presented no great difficulty to a fair
average mountaineer. Then came a rise of frozen snow
at the junction of the dome with the rocks. There was an
awkward crevasse to cross. Ole carefully tested the snow,
and it was soon overcome. We were now on the frozen
slope of the snow dome. On this, as we had no nails in
our thick fishing-boots, with the utmost difficulty we
could keep our legs. With the aid of our Alpine stock
the summit was at length reached at five minutes past
four o’clock. This is the highest mountain in Norway,
8300 feet above sea level. When we were on the rocks
of the arrête we saw a glorious sunrise over the <i>Lauvhöen</i>
Fjeld. The morning light enabled us to see a vast
wilderness of dark rocky peaks rising from a setting of
eternal snow. No sign of human habitation, no signs of
animal life&mdash;silence reigned around us. Reindeer’s bones
were lying on the rocks near the dome.

<p>On the hanging precipice of rocks, the highest in Norway,
a reindeer had met its death. The large glaciers
of Tverbrœen Svelnaasbrœ and Styggebrœen we could
see below us. The glorious sunrise had lighted up the
Lauvhöen, Hestbrœpiggene, Hesthö, Sandgrovhö, Tvœrfjeld,
Lomseggen, and Grjotaa Fjeld with its large glaciers.
Then we had the deep valley of Visdalen on one side
and Leirdalen on the other. The lofty Fjelds of the
Eisteinshovd, Kvitingskjölen, and Hjem Fjeldene in the
distance. Across Visdalen and near to us the mountains
of the Glitterhö, Glittertind,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Glitters Rundhö,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
and Troldsteens Rundhö. To the west are the mountains
of the Vesle Fjeld, the Kjœrringhœtta and many others.
What a wild boundless region of peaks to the south&mdash;far,
far beyond our sight. An endless extent of riven rock,
above the glaciers snow, of an ever frozen region. The
Stygehö, Tverbottenhorne, Kirken. Uledals Tinderne,
one of whose peaks was also afterwards ascended by
Messrs. Browne and Saunders. The Leirhö, Memurutinden,
Heilstuguhö, Tyknings, Snehö, Beshö, Sikkildals Hö,
Heimdalshö, Simletind, Skarvdalstind, Knudshultinden,
Mugna, Kalvaahögda Melkedals-tinderne, Skagastöltind,
the Koldedals-tinderne, and the wild peaks of the Horungerne.</p>

<p>Noah lighted a fire on the rocks near the dome. We
sang a gipsy song. Then a memorial of our visit was
placed in a bottle, and added to those records of former
ascents already there. At five o’clock a.m. we commenced
our descent, Ole leading, ourself next, and Noah bringing
up the rear. In the same order we had ascended. With
difficulty we kept our legs on the frozen snow sloping
from the dome. If we had rolled with Ole and Noah to
the glaciers below, our wanderings would certainly have
been at an end.</p>

<p>The rocks were soon reached, and, descending to
the glaciers below, we reached Rödsheim before ten
o’clock the same morning. This gives thirteen hours
from Rödsheim and return. Mr. Watson, who is a
member of the Alpine Club, accomplished the ascent in
1868 in nine hours and a quarter actual walking. The
Prœsten H. Halling had made the ascent, and also one of
the young ladies we had met at the Prœsten Hallings. What
cannot ladies accomplish when they make up their minds?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>The Galdhöpiggen, we were told, was first ascended
in 1851 by a schoolmaster and a farmer, who took three
days to succeed. In 1864 Ole Halvorsen, or, as he is
very often called from his farm, Ole Rödsheim, ascended
it from Rödsheim. Captain R. J. Campbell ascended it
in 1866; since then to the present time there have been
several ascents from Rödsheim. The Prœsten Honoratus
Halling, of Lom, Messrs. H. Smith, Wright, and G. H.
Wright, from Lom Rectory, H. S. Marriot, H. W. Cuthbert,
J. Dymsdale, Mr. and Mrs. Watson, and lastly,
Messrs. Boyson and Harrison, to whom Ole Halvorsen had
acted as guide before we engaged his services. Some
tourists have ascended, we believe, from Visdal since the
first ascent was made.</p>

<p>Esmeralda and Zachariah welcomed us at our camp at
Rödsheim. They had felt quite lost. Esmeralda did
not approve of our staying out all night. They had not
been able to sleep. In the middle of the night they said
an attempt had been made to steal the donkeys. Two
men were near them, and one was actually trying to
mount one of them. Esmeralda and Zachariah went up to
them, and both men ran away along the mountain road
with Esmeralda and Zachariah in pursuit. We can
imagine Mephistophiles, the descendant of some count
of Lesser Egypt, with nothing on but his shirt, swiftly
pursuing two heavy peasant descendants of some Norwegian
chief of ancient time, flapping the road with
their heavy shoes, panting and breathless to escape the
unexpected apparitions from the rocks of the Bœver
Elv in the dead of night. “Norwegians stealing,
ce n’est pas possible!” said we. “Curious to examine
the animals near the road, they had merely ventured to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
inspect them closely, and you nearly frightened them to
death.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>A dismal revelation had also to be made, for on
returning from the Galdhöpiggen it was discovered that
our siphonia overcoat, secured by straps, had been lost
on the arrête near the mountain’s summit. Ole would
then and there have returned for it, but this we would
not allow; and a look-out was to be made during the
next ascent.</p>

<p>Then our boots, which were not new when we commenced
our wanderings, were declared by Esmeralda to
be a complete wreck. Before our ascent of the Galdhöpiggen,
they had been severely tested by nearly all the
wear and tear of the distance to Rödsheim. Even
Medwin’s won’t last for ever. Then it must be remembered
we never had a single blister during the journey.
C’est quelque chose, thought we, as Esmeralda looked out
from the wardrobe pocket, another pair of Medwin’s
fishing-boots nearly new. Shall we ever forget the look
Esmeralda gave us when she held up the débris of those
replaced? Can we forget the tone in which she somewhat
reproachfully said, “Now, look at these chockas!”</p>

<p>Having made rapid but unsatisfactory résumé of the
results of our ascent, Esmeralda treated the whole affair
in a most contemptuous spirit. Instead of receiving
much laudation, our mountain expedition was looked
upon as a profitless expenditure of time, and energy, and
a reckless desertion of our tents. In our mind we contrasted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
our reception with what it might have been elsewhere.
No cannons fired as at Chamounix. No “bouquet
of flowers” as we remember at St. Gervais. No “vin
d’honneur,” no anything. We sat down to breakfast, and
felt very much as if we had done something wrong without
having done it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_356" src="images/i_356.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“NOW, LOOK AT THESE CHOCKAS”!!!</p>
</div>

<p>One thing is quite certain, the appetite of the two
mountaineers had not lost anything by the expedition.
Breakfast being completed, we adjourned with our note-book
to the cool shade of some rocks just above the
road. Esmeralda came to talk to us as we wrote. Two
or three lines went tolerably easy, then the pencil and
note-book glided from our hand, and we fell fast asleep
till mid-day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

<p>As we awoke, we perceived the silent figure of
Esmeralda still watching by us. It was found to be
time for dinner and we returned to our tents.</p>

<p>Two Swedish travellers were at Rödsheim. They
had visited our tents before we returned from the Galdhöpiggen.
One young traveller spoke some English;
he said we came to see the pretty valleys and the pretty
girls, but we see no pretty girls. We went to a sæter,
and they offer us a bed, but we see it was dirt, and sleep
in the grass. He then asked them if we could speak
Romany. “Oh, yes,” said Zachariah, “he taught us, sir.”
Then he inquired how we learned it. “I don’t know,
sir,” answered Zachariah, “but he has books.”</p>

<p>In arranging our things before tea time, we fancied that
the aquavit in our flask had somewhat diminished since
the replenishment for the two artists. The subject
being mentioned to Esmeralda, for we were always plain
with them, Noah seemed so hurt, that at last our suspicions
were disarmed. We were not very certain; we,
at any rate, blamed Noah for buying such brandy at
Veblungsnœs; it was peculiarly muddy in appearance.
We had always found Noah honest, so we ultimately
left the matter in the same inextricable confusion we
had found it, freely giving him the benefit of all doubt.
Having written a letter or two and entered a memorandum
of our ascent in the guest-book at Ole’s, he came
to our tents and had tea. As we left the house to
return to our tents we met the two artists at the door,
Who we found were going to remain at the station for
the night.</p>

<p>Ole Rödsheim had given us so much satisfaction as
guide, that we determined to engage him again. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
paid him three dollars, two marks, and twelve skillings
for his previous services, which included our ascent of
the Galdhöpiggen. Another engagement was made to
take us through the mountains to the Mörk Fos, and
<i>viâ</i> Eisbod and the Tyen Vand to the Bergen road, near
Skogstad. It was arranged that he should have four
marks a day and two days’ pay, eight marks more, for his
return home; this amount to include Ole’s board and
lodging.</p>

<p>Having carefully gone through the maps of the
different routes with Ole, we decided to start the next
day.</p>

<p>The blacksmith, who was a sober, sedate looking man,
had come occasionally to the log hut during the day to
make our kettle prop in the most approved gipsy fashion,
size, and shape. Imagine his horror and astonishment,
when he returned, after an absence, to find Mephistopheles
hammering a piece of iron into some inconceivable
shape; sparks flying, tools freely used, fire
blazing, and anvil ringing. The usurpation was almost
too much for him. With a caution to Zachariah to keep
to his own affairs, and explaining the matter to Ole as an
unfortunate instance of out-of-place ingenuity, the
kettle prop was ultimately finished and Noah’s Alpine
stock mended at a cost of three marks and a half.</p>

<p>This was to be our last evening at Rödsheim. We
were honoured by a visit from one of the beaux of the
village, who danced at Laurgaard. Alas! there was no
more dancing for our beau. The girls were either
engaged in the harvest or at the Sœters. All the
peasants were now busy in their harvest. The farmer
was carrying hay on the steep slope of the valley opposite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
our tent. Ole had a large flock of goats brought in;
the largest number we saw together in Norway. The
handsome artist, whose photograph hung in the station
at Rödsheim, came to see our tents at about ten at
night; we were just going to bed, so he did not remain
long. The Swedish travellers had left, we hope, to see
many pretty girls before they returned home. We did
not see them to speak to, or we should have recommended
them to visit Skeaker.</p>

<p>Tolerably well rested, we were up at six o’clock on
Tuesday, the 2nd of August. At seven we had breakfast
of broiled bacon, bread, and tea; Noah soon after
struck the tents, and the things were packed up; a goat’s
cheese and a “myse ost,”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and all the bread Ole could
spare, was added to our commissariat. The station at
Rödsheim is well supplied with excellent bread, beer, tea,
biscuits, potatoes, and, in fact, most requirements which
constitute the comfort of the hungry tourist. They are
comfortable quarters, and the house very clean and well
ventilated. We had no opportunity of seeing the
sleeping accommodation, but if we could form an opinion
from what we saw below, we have very little doubt that
travellers are well cared for in that respect.</p>

<p>Our cost for provisions, butter, cheese, bread, potatoes,
eggs, and milk, came to two dollars, three marks, and
fifteen skillings; and we paid three marks, eight skillings
additional postage of letters <i>viâ</i> Lom. Some of
the bread and cheese we took with us for future consumption.
At ten o’clock we took our departure after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
we had wished Mrs. Rödsheim farewell. She was a quiet,
delicate, person, but very neat and industrious and
attentive. The artists were still companions of Morpheus,
so we left them a song each, and made Mrs. Rödsheim
the present of an English book. To Ole, also, we gave
one of our songs. We also left the last “London News,”
and copies of the “Standard” at the station, and so
ended our pleasant visit at Rödsheim.</p>

<p>Noah and Zachariah went on before us with the merles
and baggage. Ourself and Esmeralda sat upon a rock
a short distance above Rödsheim waiting for Ole to
come up. The valley at this point widens; the river is
very broad, shallow, and picturesque, before it loses
itself in the deep rocky gorge at Rödsheim.</p>

<p>The scene was so charming and the morning so lovely
we could have lingered there with hours of pleasure. In
the distance up the valley we could see the small wooden
church of Bœverdal; but Ole is come, and we must
away.</p>

<p>Ole equipped for the mountains. He had high Norwegian
boots, lacing up, much resembling the ladies’
Alpine tourist boot, but of course of rougher make. Ole
had left his dark coat behind him, so as to be more at
ease. His trousers were tied round the leg below the
knee with pieces of cord; he had his knapsack, wallet,
and staff. The photograph represents Ole Halvorsen, of
Rödsheim, near Lom, as he appears in his coat. We
esteemed ourselves fortunate in having secured the
services of a guide in every way trustworthy, and
thoroughly acquainted with an extensive region of mountain
land. Ole was in the best period of his life, when
man’s strength and experience unite in maturity; as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
the companion of the reindeer hunter and Alpine tourist
he is invaluable; never makes difficulties, speaks English
well, will do the best he can to save expense, talks little,
but to the purpose, is always ready for a start at whatever
early hour you name. Turning along the mountain
road from the valley to the left of the church, we overtook
Noah and Zachariah. We were told that service is
performed in the church every fourth Sunday. It was
built, Ole said, for 2000 dollars; 500 dollars from Government,
500 dollars secured by a chief rent, and 1000
dollars contributed by the inhabitants. Not much of
our morning route had been accomplished, when we
came to a narrow bridge over a wild, rapid, foaming,
torrent, rushing over a declivity. Vain was our attempt
to get any of the donkeys over the bridge. It was
amusing to see the fierce contention; gipsies pulling,
gipsies pushing, Ole and ourself mixed up in the general
struggle without avail. Then we determined to force
them through the torrent, which rushing swiftly over
large stones, and then falling in cascades below, was
difficult to wade. We could not remain all day. One
donkey was forced in, and got safe through; another,
also, but the third, which was rather heavily laden,
would not stir till Mephistopheles suddenly jumped on
the top of the baggage. The donkey was soon staggering
through, guided by Zachariah in the rough rocks
of the stream. For a moment, the animal faltered in
its foot-hold. Are they both to be carried down the
roaring cascades? Another plunge, and by good fortune,
the donkey reached firm ground and more shallow
water; they were soon safely landed.</p>

<p>Very thankful we were that Zachariah had come out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
of the adventure safely. We had no desire to lose our
Mephistopheles, and if he had not suddenly mounted on
the spur of the moment we should have prevented him
from incurring such a risk.</p>

<p>The route was delightful; sometimes through forest
scenes and along the mountain stream, till at last we
came to the Elv Sœter at about half-past twelve
o’clock.</p>

<p>The Elv Sœter is now a large farm, though originally
it was, as the name indicates, probably nothing but a
mountain sœter.

<p>The wooden buildings are large and capacious and in
good order, and one portion of the building was surmounted
by a cupola, with a large bell to call the farm
people to meals. We noticed two enormous pine-tree
logs as we passed through the yard of the farm.
Near a log hut, a short distance beyond the farm-house,
we camped at the edge of the deep, narrow ravine, in
the depth of which we could hear the sound of the
river below. Ole said we could have some reindeer
meat, and, going to the farm, we were shown a cask
half full of salted reindeer, in a dark store under
a sort of granary. For one mark we purchased about
four pounds weight, without bone. There was a kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
crate near, with a small gröd span in it, a sort of barrel
for carrying food. We afterwards purchased a rope
made of pigs’ bristles, very light and useful, and nine
pounds of barley-meal, and another mark’s worth of
reindeer meat. The whole cost&mdash;</p>

<p>Ole said the reindeer had been killed some time, and
when we seemed to doubt whether it was killed in season,
he remarked it occasionally happened that they were
killed by accident. The reindeer hunter came to our
camp when we were having our fried reindeer and tea.
He was the son of the widow of the owner of the farm,
and she was then at a sœter. The reindeer hunter was a
tall, spare, active young fellow, fair, with his hair cut
short. He wore a Norwegian cloth cap, a coarse shirt,
without necktie, secured at the neck by a large silver
button. His loose trousers were faced with dark leather,
and also the seat; large Wellington boots of pliable
rough leather came up to nearly his knee, with red
leather let into their tops. He had something of the
bearing of Slim-slam, our friend at Laurgaard, and his
<i>tout ensemble</i> was decidedly picturesque. Ole told us
he had once been out with some artists upon the mountains
with a tent.</p>

<p>Our gipsies packed up and we left about half-past
four o’clock, which afforded us sufficient time to enter
up our notes. Our way is now through forest scenes,
up a rough mountain road. At no very great distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
on our right we had “Raudals Vand,” a large lake, and
the “Blaahö,” and “Hest-bræ-piggene” mountains.
Sometimes we were close to the Lera Elv; at other times
our route took us more into the forest. Often we
lingered to make a hasty sketch, and then Esmeralda
would wait on the side of the route lest we should miss
the track in the forest. No hobbenengree could be more
careful of the Shorengro of the expedition. Later in
the evening a mizzling rain fell, and at last we crossed
the river through a shallow ford. Near the river, below
a lofty mountain, we reached the Ytterdal Sœter.</p>

<p>The Ytterdal Sœter consisted of a collection of log
huts, with a loose stone-wall paddock behind. Cows,
goats, and bristly pigs were scattered about the trampled
ground among the rocks close to the sœter. Down the
steep mountain above we could see a picturesque vand
fos. When we came to the sœter a shepherd’s dog kept
up a constant barking which Mephistopheles did his best
to perpetuate until sharply rebuked.</p>

<p>Ole and Noah then went round the house to select a
camp ground in the inclosure. All was damp with
drizzling rain, as our gipsies drove the donkeys through
a broken gap in the wall, and pitched our tents in the
corner of the inclosure, near the sœter. Being rather
damp we changed our things, and then decided to have
gröd for our aftens-mad. Ole went to prepare the gröd
at the sœter; the rest went to learn the method of
making it. First, he filled the large iron pot of the
sœter with water, to which he added a small quantity
of salt, and a little barley-meal; the water boiled in
twelve minutes; then the woman placed the large end
of the short gröd-stick in the boiling water, and kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
rapidly swirling it backwards and forwards between the
palms of her hands, whilst Ole added from time to
time barley-meal from the bag, till the proper consistency
was obtained; the pot was taken off the fire in
about three minutes after the water commenced boiling;
the gröd was then ready to be eaten. This, with a
large can of milk, was carried to our tents for the
evening’s meal.</p>

<p>It is usual when the gröd is eaten for each person to
have two small bowls, one containing milk and the other
the gröd, and then a spoonful of gröd is taken and
dipped in the milk and so eaten. Our party afterwards
dispensed with two bowls, the gröd and milk being put
into one bowl, which saved trouble, with the same
result.</p>

<p>The wooden bowl, and the wooden spoon, and the
gröd-stick, which is made of a small fir sapling taken up
by the roots and peeled, and the roots and stump cut to
the length required, we purchased for twelve skillings
next morning from the woman of the Ytterdals Sœter,
and they are represented in the following engraving.</p>

<p>Some of the gröd we reserved for breakfast, and it is
considered all the better after it has been kept for a
short time.</p>

<p>Noah informed us at tea that he should let into the
pobengree (gip., cider) when he reached England, and
have a good soak. Gently, Noah, or there will be none
left for anyone else.</p>

<p>The women of the sœter were all lightly dressed, a
chemise and a petticoat being nearly all they had on;
They keep about twenty cows, and make from thirty to
forty cheeses in the summer season, which sell for four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
marks each. We counted forty-five goats near the sœter.
The woman’s husband was engaged at the harvest in the
lower valley.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_367" src="images/i_367.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GRÖD-STICK AND BOWL, LEIRDALEN.</p></div>

<p>It was very dark as we went to the sœter, after our
evening meal was concluded. We found three other
women there. The room was scrupulously clean. It is
certainly the most comfortable, and cleanly sœter, we met
with during our wanderings; they had a good bedstead,
convenient fire-place, and a very ingenious folding table.
It was a curious scene, as we played our music by
the fire-light and watched their interested countenances.
The women were very fair. All mountain races are fond
of music. It would seem as if the quickened instincts
of the people, whose lot is cast so much in mountain
scenes, are attuned to harmony with nature. The
women seemed much pleased. The room was dreadfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
hot and we had the door propped open, which
was the cause of occasional contests with a tame goat,
who seemed determined to come in. At last we
were glad to escape the heat and went out into a dark,
windy, rainy night. It poured with rain as we got to
our tents, yet we did not envy Ole Rödsheim his
night’s rest in the hot room of the sœter; but hot and
cold seemed all the same to Ole; Then the rain came
down so heavily it began to come into our tent, and a
trench being now dug round it we soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>The gröd and some more milk formed our frokost,
and saved tea, sugar, bread and butter. Mixed occasionally
with other food it is excellent for the mountains
where you can have fresh milk at the sœters. The
nutriment was quite sufficient for mountain work. A
meal of gröd and milk for five hungry people cost
on an average the sum of about sixpence. The cost of
the five kops of milk at the sœter was twenty skillings.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
The woman seemed well satisfied with eight skillings for
the trouble we had given her. The two pounds of
butter we purchased to take with us cost two marks
more.</p>

<p>Whilst the donkeys were being loaded, taking Zachariah
with us, we went to see the waterfall above the sœter. The
torrent dashes from the steep mountain above, and descends
in fleecy clouds to the broken rocks below. Occasionally,
above the continuous sound of the falling waters,
we could hear a rattling roar, as if loose rocks were
suddenly dashed about in the waters far above. Then
all subsided into the same constant hum of the falling
torrent. It is picturesque, but quite below comparison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
with many we had before seen, especially in Romsdal.</p>

<p>When we returned, and were ready to start, we missed
Ole, Noah, and Esmeralda, who we at last found eating
best fladbröd and cheese in the sœter. It was a present
from the woman.</p>

<p>Saying adieu to the women of the sœter, we now left
at ten o’clock. The fir woods had been left behind, and
we proceeded up the wild valley of the Lera from the
Ytterdals Sœter.</p>

<p>The Vesle Fjeld and its glaciers were on the right bank
of the Lera. One peak of dark rock rising from glaciers
on either side, Ole said had never been ascended. Ole
said Messrs. Boyson and Harrison were much pleased
with the scenery.</p>

<p>At the sœter Ole had found one of Mr. Boyson’s
spoons, which had been left there, and he was going to
return it. We were told that at one place Mr. Boyson
had accidentally left a bag containing £30, but of course
in Norway it was perfectly safe, and was afterwards
restored safely to his possession.</p>

<p>The sun became very hot. Esmeralda and Zachariah
both rode upon the baggage of their donkeys. The road
now became a more narrow track. All the donkeys were
evidently suffering from the heat. The Puru Rawnee
had fallen once, and the Tarno Rye, after falling with
Esmeralda two or three times, was unloaded, and we
halted at some rocks above a waterfall on the Lera.</p>

<p>It was an exceedingly warm spot, with no shade. The
second piece of reindeer meat was boiled in our kettle,
with some potatoes. Though rather salt, the soup was
excellent. Some of the boiled meat and potatoes were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
also eaten, and washed down with spring water. After
middags-mad we tried to write our notes, and fell fast
asleep. In fact, we were all disinclined to move, but
managed to start about four o’clock.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles was in high spirits. Noah was very
lively, which soon ended in a disagreement with Esmeralda.
We had to quiet the contending parties. The
offence charged against Noah we noted down, and it
was a serious one. In a surreptitious manner Noah had
possessed himself of his sister’s cloak, which he had tried
on, with an attempted imitation of her <i>distingué</i> style of
stepping over the rough banks of the Lera Elv. In
Noah’s clumsy imitation of his sister’s movements, which
were just the reverse of clumsy, he contrived to poke a
hole through the Alpine cloak. We say no more, only
we refer the reader to a paragraph of the short extracts
from Prœsten Sundt’s work, in our Appendix, and, as
there described, we feared similar results.</p>

<p>At about seven o’clock we encamped. The donkeys
had done better in the cool of the evening; it was
decided that they had quite enough to carry, without the
addition of extra weight, especially over the rough and
stony route before us. Adhering firmly to this resolve,
unless for the purpose of crossing some river, the animals
enjoyed this immunity for the rest of our wanderings.
The part of the valley where we had halted for
the night was very wild; there was very little verdure,
except some low stunted bushes, moss, and heath. Ole
and the gipsies gathered heath enough to make a fire for
tea. The tents were pitched exactly opposite the “Smörstab
Bræen” (Butter glacier). We contemplated with
interest an outline of sharp dark peaks rising before us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Close to us, on the east side of the Lera Elv, extended
the glacier of the “Blaabræen.” Beyond we could see the
Tverbottenhornene. A short distance from our camp we
found a deserted cabin occasionally used by reindeer
hunters.</p>

<p>It is with much pleasure we are able to say that Noah
and Esmeralda were not prevented, by results similar to
those described in the paragraph referred to in the
Appendix, from appearing at tea.</p>

<p>There was something so <i>hors de voyage ordinaire</i> in
our wandering existence, so charming in the freshness of
wild nature, so free from conventional restraint, lingering
in regions not yet spoilt by so-called art, and disfigured
by man’s attempts at civilisation. All was so silent, as
we looked from our camp fire in delighted contemplation
of the great glacier of the “Smörstab,” and the sharp-peaked
mountains separating us, as it were, from other
worlds. We had escaped for a time, the thousand and
one cares, which beset us on every side in dense populations,
and had left far behind those scenes, and voluptuous
lures, which the poet saith

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meek Peace was ever wont to shun.<br /></span>
</span></span></p>

<p>Tea was cleared away by our energetic hobbinengree.
We often silently congratulated ourselves that the tea
service was of tin, such was the rapidity with which they
sometimes vanished into her kettle bag.</p>

<p>Mr. Rödsheim, as the gipsies generally called Ole,
commenced the manufacture of birchwood cruppers for
our animals, in anticipation of steep mountain ways, and
he also engaged his time on some hobbles of the same
wood, which we wished to take to England. Then, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
night came fast upon us, Ole selected his bed between
two large rocks; with our spade he made with rough
sods a sort of turf coffin, about a foot deep, over which
he placed a large mass of heath roots, and moss which
he had peeled off the ground, the moss being turned
downwards; then our waterproof was placed over all.
When his bed was ready, he proposed that we should
start at five o’clock the next morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_372" src="images/i_372.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NORWEGIAN BIRCHWOOD CRUPPER.</p></div>

<p>“I shan’t get up at five o’clock!” shouted Esmeralda,
in a shrill voice, which nearly broke the drum of Ole’s
right ear. “I don’t care; I shan’t get up to please anybody!”</p>

<p>Noah and Zachariah looked at one another, as much as
to say, “Dawdy! she’s up; may our good shorengero
land safely on the other side.”</p>

<p>“The next day’s journey is a long one,” suggested
Ole, slowly recovering; and we promptly decided for
half-past five. Ole screwed himself into his turf coffin,
and, wrapping his head in his woollen shawl, we laid the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
waterproof over him, and he was comfortable for the
night.</p>

<p>“Well,” said we to Esmeralda, being determined to
maintain discipline, “you shall please yourself, but
remember we move on in good time to-morrow.” Our
hobbenengree was at once a study, which would have
made the fortune of an artist.</p>

<p>For a time we wrote up our notes, till the shadows of
night descended on the dark peaks, and a chill air came
from the Smörstab glacier, when we retired to rest.</p>

<p>Our sleep the next morning was disturbed by Ole
asking for matches and paper to light a fire. Very
shortly we joined him. “Now, Zachariah!’&mdash;vand! vand!”
Zachariah and Noah were soon up. We had only made
eight miles yesterday, and it was a long day’s journey
to reach the Utladal Stöl. The morning was windy, with
a heavy dew, but we could see the sun creeping down
the opposite mountain peaks, promising a hot day.</p>

<p>Tea was soon ready; a tin of potted meat was
opened, and spread upon slices of bread. All four commenced
breakfast with a good appetite.</p>

<p>When Esmeralda found that we did not attempt to
disturb her, it is wonderful how quick she appeared, and
the tents were immediately after packed up. Our camp
was about 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. We
observed some cow-dung flies and spiders in our tent
before it was packed up.</p>

<p>The rugged peaks of the Tverbottenhornene (signifying
peaks of the pass from one valley to another) rose before
us. What a line of dark peaks! The scenery of this
valley is extremely wild.

MOUNTAIN STÖL&mdash;A ROUGH PATH&mdash;THE PURU
RAWNEE’S ESCAPE&mdash;THE NARROW BRIDGE.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock we were <i>en route</i> up the valley, and
at length came in sight of the steep, dark, and pointed
mountain called “Kirken,” or “Church Mountain.” This
mountain reminded us very much of the “Trifaen Mountain,”
near the gloomy lake called Llyn Idwal, in North
Wales, which we once ascended. Even the barren sterility
of the “Trifaen,” and the shores of Llyn Idwal, and the
“Devil’s Kitchen” above; the stony wastes of the glyders,
and the rugged pass of Llanberis, have no scenes of
extreme desolation, and absence of vegetable and animal
life, similar to some of the wilder Norwegian valleys
through which we wandered. “Kirken,” we were told,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
had never been ascended. Had time permitted, we
should have been much tempted to have spent some days
on the shores of the lake near.</p>

<p>Alas! the Norwegian summer is too fleeting. When
we came up the valley, near the Leir Vand, which is
4736 feet above the sea, Ole proposed that the party
should cross the Lera. It was a tolerably wide, rapid,
broken stream, where the donkeys had to cross.</p>

<p>Ole and myself went some distance up the river, and
Ole soon crossed. We were preparing to do so, when
we saw Mephistopheles, mounted on the top of his loaded
donkey, stemming the rapid waters of the Lera in the
distance below.</p>

<p>The loaded Puru Rawnee was also bravely struggling
in the rapid current of the river for the other bank.</p>

<p>Then, as we turned again, we saw Esmeralda’s blue
feather flaunting in the wind, as, mounted on the baggage
of her loaded donkey, she was plunging across the
rough bed of the river, when, oh! the Tarno Rye has
made a false step! Our baggage gone&mdash;saturated and
spoilt! Instantaneously, a fearful splash: Esmeralda is
tumbled into the river, and the baggage saved.</p>

<p>Are those sounds of suppressed lamentation we hear
from Ole and Mephistopheles, on the bank of the Lera?
It seemed to us more like laughter than anything else
we ever heard.</p>

<p>We were too far off to render assistance, before we saw
the dripping form of our high-spirited gipsy girl rise
from the cold icy waters of the Lera. Esmeralda looked
like a beautiful Nereid&mdash;a wild water-nymph. Her long
raven hair, now without a hat, glistened with the falling
moisture of a thousand spangles in the sun. Will no one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
plunge in to help her? Would we were there! Now she
has reached the shore. Crossing the river we were soon
with our party. Esmeralda was very wet. Although
the stream was not very deep, falling in as she did, her
clothes were completely soaked. The straw hat and blue
feather, carried off by the stream, was recovered some
distance below.</p>

<p>The cold waters of the Lera had not improved the
temper of our hobbenengree. We offered her our best
consolation, and at once proceeded <i>en route</i> as the best
means of drying her clothes. Her <i>amour propre</i> had
been touched by the laughter of Noah and Zachariah.</p>

<p>Ole, with his usual tact, went as far in advance as was
compatible with his duties as guide.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles, in his most insinuating tones, said:
“Dawdy, wouldn’t the Rye have gone into the panee to
save his Romany Juval? Wouldn’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t he do so?” said Esmeralda, sharply.
“Nobody stirred; I might have drowned over and over
again for what they cared.”</p>

<p>“Well, daughter, we were just agoin’ in,” said Noah,
with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Going!” shouted Esmeralda; “go to Gorsley, and
see Lizzy. Ambrose can do it; can’t he? What a state
he makes himself over everybody else.”</p>

<p>Now Noah was up. Esmeralda, by her allusion to
Gorsley, had hit Noah in some vulnerable place.</p>

<p>The pretty little donkey, which had done its best with
a heavy load, and the addition of Esmeralda’s weight,
was of course severely anathematized; but, strange to
say, like the little jackdaw in the “Ingoldsby’s Legends,”
it seemed “never a penny the worse.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>Indeed, Esmeralda was very angry; but at last she
became more cheerful in proportion as her clothes became
more dry. We were still in sight of the Leir Vand.
There are no fish in it, or apparently in the Lera Elv.
Kirken (Church) Mountain is extremely steep and picturesque.
This view of Kirken (Church) Mountain,
steep, dark, and escarpé, and of the Tverbottenhornene,
the dark rocky mountain to the left, standing almost
isolated and apart, as seen from a point of view in the
Gravdal, we sketched during our mid-day halt.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_377" src="images/i_377.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">KIRKEN MOUNTAIN, FROM GRAVDAL.</p></div>

<p>We were not far from the Lang Vand and Visdal. Ole
said that four valleys commence near Church Mountain:
Visdal, Leirdal (Clay Valley), Gjendindal and Gravdal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
(Valley of the Grave). Four rivers have also their source
here: Visa Elv, Lera Elv, Gjendin Elv, Gravdal Elv. We
had to ford several smaller streams, and our route lay
over a wild, sterile, stony tract, among picturesque, sharp,
peaky mountains. We could see the peaks of Uledals
Tinderne, one of which was soon afterwards ascended
by Messrs. Browne. Coming at length to a small lake,
we distinctly saw on a glacier below a mountain called by
Ole the Hogvarden Tind (Peak of the High Pass), a herd
of about forty-five wild reindeer. We were not very far
from them. Under the shelter of scattered rocks we
could have had a still closer view. Ole regretted he had
not brought a rifle. They might have been stalked
easily. The sun was also in our favour. Although for
some time we were in view of the reindeer, they did not
notice us, and when we went out of sight the herd were
still on the glacier. It was a beautiful sight as we watched
them on the sloping snow. Descending down the valley,
we called a halt at a large rock near a small mountain
stream. We had accomplished a distance of about eight
or nine miles. It was about twelve o’clock. Not far
from where we halted runs Simledal (Hart’s Valley), and
beyond us Ole pointed out the direction of the Raudal
(Red Valley).</p>

<p>We were now in our element. How could we be unhappy
in such picturesque scenes, pure nature, pure air,
free existence? Even our gipsies were in keeping with
the rough unhewn rocks and wild flowers of this unfrequented
region. Just at this point of reflection Mephistopheles,
who was boiling our can of water over a fire of
heath roots and moss, called out in a melancholy screaming
tone of voice, exactly imitating his sister at our camp
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
the evening before, “Where’s the tea? Zachariah!!
where’s the tea?” It was so true to tone and manner
that, braving Esmeralda’s displeasure, even Ole joined in
the laugh. All was immediately fun and merriment in
our camp. Even Esmeralda deigned to laugh. The reindeer
meat, boiled the day before, was fried with potatoes.
This with tea formed an excellent meal&mdash;in fact, Ole
said many in Lom never had such a dinner.</p>

<p>Our gipsies were full of fun. Zachariah put up an
impromptu tent with two of our tent raniers and an
Alpine stock, to shade Ole from the sun, and he at once
fell asleep. Then Zachariah contrived one for himself,
which was taken possession of by Noah, after a mimic
battle. Esmeralda put the things away, and all took
their siesta, while we made two sketches and entered
up our diary. At twenty minutes to four our party
were again <i>en route</i> down the valley.</p>

<p>The donkeys were quickly loaded. Over rough uneven
ground we descended the valley until we were below the
picturesque Storbeatind and its singular glacier.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Ole
said it was so called, and that the Utladal Elv derived its
source from the Gravdal Vand. The river from this singular
glacier branched into many streams. Between two
sterile steeps the glacier narrows in its course and falls
abruptly into the valley.</p>

<p>Above the almost straight line of glacier wall we saw
an isolated, lofty, peculiarly-shaped mass of ice, which
put us in mind of one of the ice cliffs in the Glacier des
Bossons at Mont Blanc, so well represented by Coleman
in his “Scenes from the Snow Fields, or the Upper Ice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
World.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> The glacier seemed to overhang the narrow
valley. The approaching night added to its picturesque
effect.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>Ole crossed the river at some rocks below. Noah,
Zachariah, and Esmeralda crossed with the donkeys. They
all had to stand a thorough drenching of their legs and
feet in the ice cold-water fresh from the glacier. Esmeralda
stood it manfully. We went a short distance below,
and, taking off our trousers, boots, and stockings, waded
through. The cold was intense. As we came up with
our party, they had just seen a reindeer; it was coming
towards them, and was quite close before it perceived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
our party and turned again. Zachariah gave chase; but
it slowly made its way among some loose rocks, and he
lost sight of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_381" src="images/i_381.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ICE CLIFF, STORBEATIND GLACIER.</p></div>

<p>The track was now extremely rugged, tortuous, and
steep at times. We had several streams to cross, and
made our way with difficulty. In crossing one narrow
brook Zachariah’s donkey, which was very sure footed,
slipped back, and part of its load, containing Ole’s things
in a pig’s bristle bag, and the pocket containing Noah’s
blankets, and our kettle bag, got slightly wet before we
could get it out.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose; on we went, and at length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
we came to a very interesting steep mountain way between
red rocks. Here we had the Red Sandstone formation
suddenly appearing near mountains of gneiss. The
gipsies had hard work of it. Each of the donkeys had to
be carefully led, and the loads steadied. Sometimes the
loads, in going down a steep descent, would slip forwards,
and in ascending would get nearly over the animal’s
tail; so that the load had to be readjusted. We did the
best we could with Ole’s impromptu cruppers. It was
hard work for Esmeralda; but we relieved her as much
as possible. Ole was ever at hand when a difficulty
occurred.</p>

<p>We must say that our gipsies stuck to their work
bravely. It was not long after we had come to the Red
Sandstone rocks, that the Puru Rawnee slipped backwards
into some deep boggy ground. It was impossible to avoid
at times such mishaps. We had sometimes no choice,
and on we must go. Noah, Ole, and Zachariah, at last,
by pushing and lifting and dragging, got it out.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles, whose loud laugh rang amongst the
rocks, was ever gay; but his laughter became wonderfully
like poshavaben (gip., false laughter), when Ole said,
in joke: “Master Zâkē], we shall have to cross the
river just now.”</p>

<p>Night was rapidly drawing on, and we had not yet
reached the Utladal Stöl. At last we came to a romantic
reindeer hunter’s cave. It had a narrow entrance in the
rocks; no outlet for the smoke from the inside but the
entrance. Traces of fire remained, and we noticed marks
on a bank near where the hunters had tried their rifles.
We had only time to explore it, and make a hasty
sketch.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, just at dusk, we came to the open
ground of the Utladal Stöl. It was a small melancholy
valley. On a rise of ground, a short distance from us,
we could see the stöl or sœter built of loose stones, one
story high with one window. Somehow the stöl had a
dismal deserted appearance. Some cows were grazing
near.</p>

<p>We were close to the river, some hillocks covered
with low bushes only intervening. The donkeys were
very tired, and it was just nine o’clock. Even Noah was
out of sorts. The cows rendered the camp ground far
from desirable. There was no time for much choice, or
we should have tried some other ground. The woman of
the sœter was out, so that we could not have cream
porridge as intended. A small boy represented the
woman. Our tents were quickly put up. Noah said he
liked places where you could see plenty of people. This
was the only camp ground we had disliked through our
wanderings. It seemed like a valley where a dozen
suicides had been committed, supplemented by an undiscovered
murder. Though the influences were dull
and gloomy, we made an excellent meal of tea with
fried ham, and Ole informed us that the woman had
returned, and we could have “flödsgröd” the next
morning.</p>

<p>Ole, in answer to our inquiries, said that there were
no fish in the Utladals Elv, only newts, black-looking
water lizards, sometimes called “asgals,” in England
“lacerta palustris.” There were no birds; even the
“philomela lascinia,” or one-headed nightingale, usually
considered a foolish bird and easily caught, was not fool
enough to perch in this valley.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span></p>

<p>Ole retired as quickly as he could to occupy the bed
at the stöl, where we were told Messrs. Boyson and
Harrison had stayed one night&mdash;we do not say slept,
for we are extremely uncertain whether they did so.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Romany chaff&mdash;for the gipsies
were blowing great guns during tea, and pronounced the
place in an impressive manner to be “mumply”&mdash;we
got an excellent night’s rest in our comfortable tent,
lulled quickly to sleep by the rushing waters of the
Utladal Elv.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we were performing our matutinal
ablutions on the banks of the Utladals Elv, regardless of
the newts, who might be staring at such an unusual
visitor. Then we had a consultation with Ole about
our future route. On reference to our maps and a calculation
of the different routes to be followed, it seemed
that we should reach Christiania with difficulty at the
time we proposed. We sighed for a double summer in
such a splendid country for mountaineering. At first
we thought of giving up our visit to Mörkfos; then
remembering Captain Campbell’s description of this
magnificent fall, we determined it must be visited, even
if we pushed through the rest of the journey by forced
marches.</p>

<p>Our breakfast of “flödsgröd” was prepared by the
woman and ready at eight o’clock. For the information
of our readers, we will describe how it is made. Two
quarts and a half of beautiful cream were boiled by the
sœter woman in an iron pot, to which we added some of
our barley meal carried from Elvsœter. This was mixed
together with the gröd-stick, and carried down to our
tent. The flödsgröd was quite sufficient for the breakfast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
of five persons, and is a dish highly prized by the
Norwegians, being eaten without the addition of anything
else. It is very rich; the butter from the cream
floating about at the top in a melted state.</p>

<p>The two quarts and a half of cream cost us one mark
twelve skillings, and we gave the woman four skillings,
which Ole suggested as quite sufficient. All the party
excepting perhaps Ole, preferred the ordinary gröd with
milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_385" src="images/i_385.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">UTLADAL STÖL, MUMPLY VALLEY.</p></div>

<p>The woman was a thick-set strong young person who
lived alone at the sœter with her little boy. She had
plenty of occupation; seventeen cows to milk every
day, besides taking care of seventeen goats and twenty
sheep.</p>

<p>The Utladal Stöl was built with loose granite stones,
earth, and sods, forming one long low building, divided
interiorly into three compartments, one opening into the
other across the ground floor. They had hardened mud
floors. The second room contained a fire hearth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
chimney and bed, and was lighted with one small
window which did not open; the compartment was used
as a dairy. There were three ventilators or holes in the
roof, which, by the aid of a long stick attached to a
square piece of board, could be lifted or closed at pleasure.
The Utladal Stöl was roofed partly with turf and partly
with flat stones. In the Bergen Stift we were told that
the sœters are called “stöls.” The Utladal Stöl was
much like the dwelling-houses which were often met
with formerly in the wild parts of Carnarvonshire and
other counties in North Wales. In Norway the stöls are
not used as dwellings like similar buildings were in
former times in Wales. They are only occupied for a
short period of the year in summer. Two guns, for
shooting reindeer, hung from the roof of one of the
rooms.</p>

<p>We were glad to leave, at ten o’clock, this melancholy
part of the valley, which is between the Raudals Hö, or
Hill of the Red Valley, and the Utladals Axelen. The
donkeys were not very fresh, and ascended slowly the
steep ascent from the stöl. Esmeralda’s donkey, the
Tarno Rye, was rather weak at starting. The Puru
Rawnee was stronger, but its back was a little sore.
Our cruppers were made of twisted birch twigs wrapped
with a piece of carpet. Birch twigs are used for a
variety of purposes in Norway&mdash;crates, net baskets,
hobbles, cruppers, fastenings for sails, oars, withes for
gates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we descended the other side of the
hill towards a stream called the Lille Utladals Elv. The
gipsies called it a “slem drom.” Our donkeys made
their way with difficulty, and great care had to be used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
to keep the loads in place and the donkeys on their
legs.</p>

<p>Reaching the rapid waters of the torrent in order to
avoid the deep boggy ground on its bank, we were
obliged to go upon the loose stones and shelving rocks on
the brink of the stream.</p>

<p>In reaching the river the Puru Rawnee had fallen twice,
and the second time had broken our tent pole into two
pieces. Ole and ourselves took some of the things and
carried them to lighten the weight.</p>

<p>The Utladals Elv, by which we had camped the previous
night, was roaring between some precipitous rocks just
beyond, and flowed into the stream we were following.
At the junction we had to cross a narrow bridge over
the Utladals Elv.</p>

<p>Some sloping slippery shelving rocks at the brink of
the Lille Utladals Elv, had to be crossed to reach the
bridge over the other stream. The first attempt was
made with the Puru Rawnee, whose legs slipped from
under it, and sliding down the slippery rock on its side,
was held back by Noah just in time to prevent its going
into the river. One end of the pocket was already in the
stream, and the Puru Rawnee and our baggage upon her
in another minute would have probably been carried down
the rapid torrent and lost. Noah succeeded in holding
her on the rock till we got some of the baggage unloosed.
She was at length recovered, and the other donkeys were
afterwards safely guided over the same rock to the
bridge.</p>

<p>There was no wading at this part of the Utladals Elv.
We had a strong, deep, heavy current of waters rushing
with wild impetuosity under the overhanging rocks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
High above the foaming waters, a narrow frail bridge,
with a wicket and slight hand rail on each side, spanned
the river. The Utladals Elv formed its junction just
below with the Lille Utladals Elv. Ole stepped across
the bridge with I don’t know how many pounds of
baggage, on his shoulder, as if he expected the whole
cavalcade to follow <i>à pas de chasseurs de Vincennes</i>.

<p>As Cadurcis approached, he observed some low tents, and in a few
minutes he was in the centre of an encampment of gipsies. He was
for a moment somewhat dismayed; for he had been brought up with
the usual terror of these wild people; nevertheless, he was not unequal
to the occasion. He was surrounded in an instant, but only with
women and children; for gipsy men never immediately appear. They
smiled with their bright eyes, and the flames of the watch fire threw a
lurid glow over their dark and flashing countenances; they held out
their practised hands; they uttered unintelligible, but not unfriendly
sounds.</p>

<p>The three donkeys looked as if they much preferred
remaining where they were. Esmeralda said we should
never get over.</p>

<p>Noah said “No donkeys can go over such places as
these, sir.”</p>

<p>“What can we do in such ways?”</p>

<p>Even Mephistopheles had not quite shaken off the
gloom of our last camp, and looked “mumply.” We did
not say much.</p>

<p>“There’s the other side. They must go.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<p class="caption">LUSEHAUG BRO, UTLADAL.&mdash;RESTIVE DONKEYS.</p></div>

<p>And without losing more time we all set to work and
carried the baggage over. Then came the Tarno Rye’s
turn; Zachariah pulled at its head, whilst ourself and
Noah pushed behind, and forced it by main strength up
the stones to the wicket. It was almost over the cliff
once, but we both laid hold of a hind leg each, whilst
Mephistopheles tugged at the donkey’s head. As the frail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
bridge shook it is lucky we did not all vanish into the
chasm below. With main force the Tarno Rye was
lifted on to the bridge, and finding itself there quietly
allowed itself to be led by Zachariah and Ole to the
other side.</p>

<p>It was rather expected we should succeed in the same
way with the other two, but they made such a resolute
fight that there was considerable risk of losing one of the
donkeys through the handrail at the end of the bridge.</p>

<p>“Bring the tether rope, Noah.”</p>

<p>We then proposed to noose them by the head, and so
drag them over. Noah further suggested that we might
double the rope and pass it round the donkeys hind
quarters. It was a good idea immediately adopted. The
Puru Rawnee was the first. Esmeralda and Zachariah at
the ends of the doubled rope across the bridge. Ourself
on the bridge steadying its head. Noah and Ole pushing
behind.</p>

<p>Sharp was the contest, first at the stones leading to
the bridge, then at the light rails at the end of the
bridge which shook under our weight as the donkey resisted.
Now and again Esmeralda pulled. Mephistopheles
pulled, and the Puru Rawnee, at length, sorely
against her will, was dragged over the bridge.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Puru Rye was also soon pulled over by the same
method, amid much laughter from our gipsies. In a few
minutes the donkeys were again loaded.</p>

<p>“What is the name of the bridge?” asked we.</p>

<p>“Lusehaug Bro,” said Ole as we pushed along the
Utladals Elv, and whilst we gradually ascended obliquely
higher above the Utladals Elv, so the Utladals Elv
seemed to sink deeper, and deeper, into the hidden
recesses of a bottomless ravine. In a short time we
entirely lost sight of its rapid waters.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>This river is ultimately joined by the waters from the
Mörkfos. After winding along the hill side we reached
a sort of upper plateau at the foot of the Skögadal.</p>

<p>Near the Skögadals Elv are two sœters some short
distance apart, on the banks of the Elv, whose swift
course is soon lost down the precipitous steeps which
abruptly fall from the plateau to the dark narrow
ravine below. Halting at a short distance from the
Skögadal sœters, a fire was lighted, and we had fried
bacon and potatoes and tea for dinner. Until we had
another tent pole it was impossible to pitch our tent.
Shortly after dinner it poured with rain, but our baggage
was all safely covered with our siphonia waterproof.
Ole showed his ready skill by cutting down a small
birch tree in the wood just above us, which he shaped out
with his hunting knife to the proper size and length, and
then cut holes sufficiently large for our tent raniers. A
very good substitute Ole made. We have it now, after all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
the rough work of our remaining campaign. There was
a slight cessation of rain, during which the tents were
pitched. We were delighted with our camping ground.
All were pleased with it. It was certainly a wild,
secluded, and beautiful spot. There was the pleasing
reflection that we were at home in our pleasant camp. No
care, no trouble, no sleeping in sœter beds in a suffocating
close atmosphere, or lying on mud floors, slimy with
spilt milk and damp moisture. No anticipation of fleas,
with the certainty of such anticipation being realized to
the fullest extent of human endurance. Then there are
floating visions as to the number and variety of people
who have previously slept in these beds. Some idea may
be formed of sœter life by the following extract of recent
personal experience, related by Mr. Murray Browne:&mdash;“I
prepared for the night by pulling on my second
shirt and second pair of trousers over that which I
was wearing at the time. I then lay down on the
floor with a rug&mdash;a sort of horse-cloth&mdash;under me, and
a rope for my pillow. My brother and Saunders slept
on a sort of bench, with their legs stretched under a
kind of shelf which served as the only table. The
women and children occupied the only bed, and Hans
and his son slept, like myself, on the floor. Before
long it got very cold.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>On the right of the Utladals Elv a foaming torrent
falls from an upper plateau of the Horungerne. On our
left we could see the Skögadals Elv, and on the opposite
side the Aurdals Axelen, forming the two sides of the
valley out of which issues the Skögadals Elv, and falls
down rocky steeps into the deep gorge of the Utladal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
A beautiful green, moss-covered, rocky, low hill, formed
our foreground on the opposite side of the Skögadals
Elv. As you look down the deep gorge beyond, two hills
rise in picturesque outline, one with a very steep,
dark summit. The white foam of a waterfall contrasts
with the dark rocks of the mountain down which it falls.
In the far distance a small pointed hill stands alone. It
is far down the gorge, as far as the eye can reach. For
our tea we had gröd and milk. Ole retired to the sœter
at eight o’clock, and as it rained heavily we all went to
bed. When we retired to rest on the mossy turf; we
could not help expressing pity for the unfortunate people
stoved up in the sœters. Ole said it would probably rain
next day, but if fine it was arranged that he should call
us up at three o’clock the next morning.</p>

<p>It rained heavily when we awoke about three o’clock
so that we continued our repose. Ole called us at a
much later hour. We gave him out of our tent, matches,
and material for making the fire, and soon joined him.
The gipsies also were up and stirring. Esmeralda soon
managed the breakfast service from her kettle bag, which
was quite equal to Pandora’s box for the extraordinary
quantity and variety of things it contained. The frokost
consisted of fladbröd, butter and tea. The day was dull
and cloudy. We could hear with greater distinctness the
roar of the rising waters of the Skögadals Elv. This was
pleasant, except that we had the prospect of having one
or two of our donkeys drowned in crossing the rapid
waters.</p>

<p>The morning gradually cleared, and we diligently
wrote up our notes till one o’clock. Esmeralda then announced
our mid-day meal. The hobbenengree had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
boiled some of Ole’s bacon with the unfortunate piece of
dried meat from Holaker, which had persistently haunted
our soup kettle for so many miles. There was no mistaking
it as Noah pronged it out with a fork, and suddenly
let it fall back into the soup, as if he had seen the ghost
of his Uncle Elijah.</p>

<p>Although not in our arrangement Ole had always had
his meals from our commissariat. Ole Rodsheim was
worthy of our hospitality, and we had enough to spare.
On this occasion Ole said he had shared all our meals,
and we might as well consume the bacon, and three
loaves of bread he had brought with him. As to our tea
Ole had acquired such a taste for it, that we doubt
whether he will ever again be able to do without it.
Our meal consisted of soup, boiled bacon, the mysterious
piece of dried meat, potatoes and fladbröd.</p>

<p>When we looked over the maps after dinner with Ole,
we could not help being astonished at the <i>étendue</i> and
wonderful extent of wild mountain terrain scarcely
explored by the Alpine Club. What a network of
deep gorges, glens, valleys, lakes, and glaciers, out of
which rise hundreds of steep and rugged peaks; very
many have never been ascended and are scarcely known.
Three lakes were pointed out by Ole as having been
purchased by English gentlemen; the Rus Vand, the
Heimdals Vand, and the Sikkildals Vand. Some of the
lakes are of considerable extent, as the Bygdin Vand,
which Ole said was about seventeen and a half miles
long. The Gjendin Vand and the Tyen Vand were also
large lakes easily reached from near our tent. After a
careful inspection of our maps, we decided to take Ole
early the next morning and visit the Mörk Fos, leaving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
the gipsies in care of the camp, and returning in the
evening. A reconnaissance was made up the Skögadals
valley above the sœters to find a crossing for our
donkeys; the usual ford was too deep. Noah and
Zachariah said no donkey could stand with water above
his knees. The place, at last selected, was certainly
better for our purpose, but we were not very sanguine.
Ole said a carrier was expected at the sœter that evening,
and some help might be obtained.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening after the rain. The view
up the Skögadal (wooded valley) with Melkadalstinderne
(the peaks of the Milk valley) in the distance, and
across the river the Aurdals Axelen, which Ole said
meant the shoulder of the stony valley, completed a
scene long to be remembered; the sides of the Skögadal
valley being covered in places with birch wood, has not
the too sterile and desolate appearance of some valleys
through which we had passed. About five o’clock,
when we were having our gröd and milk for tea, the
expected carrier and his boy were seen coming up
the mountain track below our tents. The horses shied
at first at our camp, but Noah went down and
led one, and they passed without difficulty. Each
horse can carry about eight vaage, rather more than
3 cwt., each Norwegian vaage being 38 lbs. One
of the carrier’s horses was a powerful animal, larger
than the Norwegian pony. Two strong wooden barrels,
with lids, are slung on each side a wooden frame or
saddle furnished with iron rings and a leather crupper.
The barrels are two feet two inches long, by eleven and
three-quarter inches wide, and one foot eight inches
deep. The weight is well balanced, and the fastenings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
very strong and well adapted to stand the rough stony
tracks of the Norwegian fjelds. An arrangement was
quickly made for the carrier to take Ole and ourself
across the Skögadals Elv the next morning, and bring us
back in the evening, for half a mark each. It rained
heavily after tea. About nine o’clock, when it was over,
we took Noah and Zachariah to the upper sœter to give
the people some music. Ole was there, the carrier, and
his son, and the sœter women. As we came in we
made our début in the Skögadal world of music by
slipping on the uneven mud floor of the first room, and
falling down, nearly upsetting the sœter woman’s bucket
of milk, who was milking, and if we had not been
very quick completely smashing our guitar. Our
satisfaction at having rescued our guitar which had been
carried without injury by Esmeralda so many miles,
quite healed any bruises we sustained. No bones broken;
we were soon up, and in the second room. The violin,
guitar, and tambourine, soon waked up the stillness of
the night. We must say that no artistes of the greatest
celebrity could have had a more pleased and admiring
audience. As we retired we felt quite giddy from the
extreme closeness of the atmosphere of the sœter. Noah
had also carried off two fleas; so much the better for
Ole. The night was damp and windy as we sought our
camp and went to bed.</p>

<p>Early awake, we were completing our toilette to the
music of snoring gipsies when Ole came. Half-past five,
gröd and milk formed our breakfast, Ole adding to his
own some myse ost, to qualify, as he said, the milk.
The carrier came with one of his horses; we both
mounted and forded the Skögadals Elv, and turning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
horse back he returned across riderless to his master.
Commencing our expedition at seven o’clock, we made
our way for some distance through a large birch wood,
and at length descended into the valley called Aurdal.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
This part of the narrow valley which we crossed is completely
full of enormous stones piled one upon another
in wild chaos. Ole called the valley Urdal or Aurdal.
All was wild sterility, and the separate detached blocks
of loose stone were often so enormous, that it was slowly,
and with difficulty we made our way to the opposite
side. A stream flowed far beneath the loose stones
tossed and piled above its course in extraordinary
masses. Its waters were at times obscured and hidden
by the blocks of stone of all shapes and sizes, piled in
heterogeneous confusion. When we left this stony valley
we continued our route along the sloping sides of the
mountain beyond, to the left of the deep gorge of the
Utladals Elv. At about eleven o’clock in the forenoon we
reached the “Fleskedal Sœter.” The stöl is pleasantly
situated on a rise of open mountain ground near a clear
stream of water. Leaving our things with the sœter
woman, we descended through a steep forest of birch
and firs, and at last crossing a new bridge over a wild
torrent soon afterwards reached another stöl or sœter
which was closed. This was the Vettismark forest and
sœter. Ole said that this forest was renowned for its
large trees. Round the sœter the trees were partly
cleared; some were left scattered here and there. The
whole scene reminded us of a sheep station in an
Australian forest. From this picturesque plateau we
had splendid views of some of the summits of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
Horungerne mountains. The scene was beautiful in the
sunshine of mid-day; it made us wish to linger there
for ever. What a spot for a tent. Crossing the narrow
stream near the sœter, and passing through a lovely
forest view, we were soon near the edge of the hanging
cliff, over which the narrow river we had crossed, falls
in one straight and almost perpendicular column of
water, not less than 800 feet&mdash;we thought it more. In
a note to Captain Campbell’s interesting article on the
Mörkfos, published in the “Alpine Journal” of August
1870, it seems that the height of the fall is about
1000 feet.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>We refer our readers to this article for an excellent
description of this waterfall, and especially to the engraving
there given of the fall, which is from an original
sketch by Captain Campbell.</p>

<p>The sun shone high; the sky was Italian blue. Ole
produced his rope; carefully securing it round our body,
he steadied himself at a small tree and held the other
end of the rope. Then we advanced to the edge of
the hanging cliff. The wild heath formed an arched
and matted roof above the far distant rocks in the
abyss below. As we cautiously leant over, Nature broke
upon us in all the light of her splendid magnificence.
Who can doubt the power of a great Creator who
views such scenes? We could have stayed there never-tiring
to eternity. As we seemed to catch as it were the
broken ground with our legs, almost suspended in mid
air, we could not divest ourselves of the thought that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
some of the finest scenes in Nature are often overlooked.
Had the shelving cliff given way we were secured by a
rope, but we must say our position would have been
unpleasant. The cliffs on either side stand abruptly out
and are overhanging, so that it is difficult to get a good
view of the fall from above, except at the point we
were looking over. The rocks below, which receive the
waters of the fall, for some distance upwards are almost
black.</p>

<p>When we retired from the cliff’s edge, we roped Ole
and he had a similar view. Notwithstanding all that
had been said by Captain Campbell, the Mörkfos far surpassed
our expectations in height, volume of water, and
picturesque beauty. There is no drawback. All accessories
are perfect. Mountain outline, rock, tree, forest&mdash;all
that surround the fall, rival it in their several perfections
of harmonious beauty. Reluctantly we must say, that
even the Rjukan fos and its romantic association of the
“Lovers” or “Marie stein” is scarcely equal to the
Mörkfos.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Other lovers of nature who visit this wild
scene may probably pass a decisive opinion either to confirm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
or reverse ours. Both falls have their separate
beauty.</p>

<p>The valley of the Aardal below, is all the most enthusiastic
lover of nature could desire.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Opposite to us were the
magnificent steeps of the Maradalstinder. The waterfall
roaring down its sides, was only dwarfed, by its more
splendid rival the Mörkfos. The fall opposite is the
Maradals elv fos. As we watched it, a beautiful iris of
red, yellow, and blue, hovered above the foaming waters,
the only one, we had ever seen.</p>

<p>Before we left, we contemplated the deep valley of the
Aardal, and its wooded sides. Trees covered the summit
of the cliffs, on either side the Mörkfos. One mountain
ash, had caught its roots in a cleft, and overhung in mid-air.
Scotch firs crowned the rocks above.</p>

<p>We left at a quarter to one. Never shall we forget a
small patch of golden moss, forming a miniature island in
a small forest tarn; its resplendent colour in the glowing
sun. Near the sœter in the Vettismark forest, a few
large trees scattered near, were without bark, and dead.
The Vettismark Sœter, and the Fleskedal Sœter, Ole said,
belonged to the same owner. The ascent to the Fleskedal
Sœter was very steep, but we reached it at five
minutes past two o’clock.</p>

<p>Our middags mad, on the banks of the stream, near
the Fleskedal Sœter, consisted of cold bacon, fladbröd, a
box of sardines, and kage bröd, or ovens bröd (bread
baked in an oven), which we had brought with us. Ole
boiled our water at the sœter, and we had two pannikins
of tea. The Fleskedal Sœter is a new sœter. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
woman, and some children, were staying there. The
sœter is built of wood, and of the usual size. We paid
the woman four skillings, for allowing Ole to boil our
water at the sœter.</p>

<p>It appears that Messrs. Boyson and Harrison stayed at
the Fleskedal Sœter one night, with three other gentlemen
going to Lyster. We were told that for one bed, for two
of the party, the other three sleeping as they could, and
for some fladbröd, butter, and milk, they were charged two
specie dollars, or nine shillings English money, when they
left. An English gentleman, accompanied by a reindeer
hunter, came to the Fleskedal Sœter the day before we
arrived, and stayed all night. Early in the morning
he had shot a reindeer in the mountains.</p>

<p>The English sportsman returned to the sœter for a
pony, but could not get one, and went to obtain one somewhere
else. He said he should reserve the reindeer’s skin for
himself, and send the carcass to a friend at Bergen. Ole
said he would probably have to pay two or three dollars,
and if he had sent it down to Skögadals Sœter, the
carrier would have met the steamer for Bergen, and it
would have gone at a much cheaper rate.</p>

<p>Leaving Fleskedal Sœter at about four o’clock, we had
a delightful walk along the mountain slopes. At one
point, in the depths of the valley below, on the opposite
bank of the Utladal Elv, we could see the Bondegaard of
Vormelid. A deep dark shadow seemed to hang about it
in the far distance below. What a solitary abode. Few
footsteps would ever pass its threshold. Imagine the
winter solitude of this homestead. The silence broken
by the wolf’s howl. Ole said the bears had destroyed the
cattle of the former owner. He was nearly ruined. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
bridge across the torrent was broken down, and the house
deserted. Ole signaled as we approached the Skögadals
Elv. The gipsies were soon on the alert to give us welcome.
The carrier brought two horses, and we crossed
the river. Our tents were reached at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>The gipsies appeared to have slept most of the day.
They had not even quarrelled. We began to think they
must be ill, until we found they had diligently inspected
nearly every single article we possessed, which were
afterwards carefully arranged upside down. We decided
to move very early the next day, and Ole had the gröd
at once prepared for breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>Before retiring to rest, we strolled on the turf near our
tents, and watched the secluded valley by moonlight.
Vast ranges of snowy mountains were before us silvered
by the moon. As we looked down the valley, we could
not help observing, a large shadowed outline, representing
the figure of a woman, singularly distinct, and formed by
the conformation of a hill above the ravine. It was
Sunday, and no music was given at the sœters.

<p>“That gipsy grandmother has all the appearance of a sowanee” (sorceress).&mdash;“All
the appearance of one!” said Antonio; “and is she
not really one? She knows more crabbed things, and crabbed words
than all the errate betwixt here and Catalonia; she has been amongst

taste, and shortly after I had done so, my soul departed from my
body, and wandered through horrid forests and mountains, amidst
monsters and duendes, during one entire night. She learned many
things amidst the Corahai, which I should be glad to know.”</p>

<p>Some little delay occurred in getting the carrier and
his horse. He was the husband of the woman of one of
the sœters. She was a tall powerful woman, with a red
face, and sharp temper, much older than himself. It was
whispered that he had married her for her money. If he
had, she had certainly the best of the bargain. Our tents
and heavy baggage, were soon packed up in a meisgrie or
crate, and slung up on the wooden packsaddle of the
carrier’s horse. The Norwegian meisgrie is a capital contrivance.
It is a kind of network made of birch twigs,
which laces up with a long tie, one foot eleven inches long.
It is very strong and very light. Wishing the sœter women
farewell, and they seemed sorry to lose us, especially the
music, we soon reached the river.</p>

<p>Our people and baggage were soon forded across. We
remained behind with our three donkeys, having a
tether rope stretching across the river. Fastening it with
a noose round the Puru Rawnee’s neck, she was first
pulled across, plunging and struggling to the other bank.
The Tarno Rye was assisted through the stream in a similar
manner. The Puro Rye saved us the trouble by jumping
into the stream, to follow his companions. There was a
loud outcry by the gipsies that he would be drowned,
but he fought through the torrent famously, and reached
the other bank in safety.</p>

<p>The view was beautiful as we looked up the Skögadal.
The Melkadalstind towered above the mountain ranges,
which closed the upper portion of the valley, leaving no
outlet, but a stony col on the distant ridge. The occasional
wooded sides of the valley, with firs, birch, and
dark foliaged alder, relieved the valley from all appearance
of desolation. The white foam of two torrents, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
occasional patches of snow, on the mountain sides, at the
head of the valley, contrasted well with wooded slopes
which margined the winding stream.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_406" src="images/i_406.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIEW OF MELKADALSTIND, FROM THE VALLEY OF SKÖGADAL, SKÖGADALS ELV.</p></div>

<p>We had now crossed the river, and, following over the
broken ground of its right bank, we at length reached
the head of the pleasant valley of Skögadal. Again we
had to cross the Skögadals Elv now a narrow impetuous
torrent, rushing forth from a glacier, at some distance to
our right.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

<p>The carrier with his strong horse, for which he wanted
sixty dollars, crossed easily enough. Noah and Zachariah
managed somehow to get to the other side with the
donkeys. The Skögadals Elv was now not very wide,
but rapid, and over our knees, in the middle of the stream,
which was icy cold. Never shall we forget Ole in a
narrow part of the stream, out of which rose two rocks,
balancing on one, whilst he steadied Esmeralda, who
had jumped on the other. The torrent narrowed in its
course, swift, and impetuous, occasionally laved with its
flowing waters Esmeralda’s boots, as she stood on the
slippery rock, preparing, with Ole’s assistance, to make
another jump. It was a question for some minutes
whether Esmeralda would not lose her foothold, and drag
Ole after her, into the foaming waters.</p>

<p>The scene was charming, the reindeer hunter on one
rock, Esmeralda on the other, both hand in hand.
Balanced above the flowing waters; sometimes we
thought Esmeralda was slipping backwards, now with
Ole’s assistance she has recovered herself. Another jump
across the foaming waters; Esmeralda hesitates. A word
of encouragement, Esmeralda jumps. She has reached
Ole’s rock, she balances again; thanks to Ole, by another
hasty spring, she is safe on the other side.</p>

<p>Soon joining our party, we ascended a winding stony
track from the Skögadal, passing through a col, we
reached a second long wild valley, wild and stony in
the extreme, here and there a glacier above. The fine
peak of the “Melkedals” above us. Sometimes we
skirted the margin of small sheets of water, and lonely
mountain tarns. Over this long reach of broken rock we
made our way slowly; at last we again ascended towards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
another col, to reach apparently another valley beyond.
We had nearly reached the top of the ascent towards the
next valley, when the carrier suddenly halted, and Ole
said he wished to take something to eat. Our carrier was
a quiet, spare, muscular, and not bad-looking man; we
had noticed him when we crossed the river; no shouting,
bustle, bewilderment, or gesticulation, he simply did
quietly what he thought best. If it did not succeed,
and we had all been drowned, it is doubtful whether he
would have moved a muscle of his countenance. Yet he
was not a man without feeling, and would probably have
felt all the more. All was regulated to one steady pace
for horse and man, and to save the world he would not
have gone slower or faster. A fire was made with the
roots of stunted juniper, and our water boiled for tea.
Our carrier had only some fladbröd, and raw old bacon
for his dinner. From our commissariat we supplemented
it with tea, and brandy and water. It was soon found
that when we had halted at twelve o’clock, he considered
his bargain ended, and that he was entitled to his dollar,
and an extra mark for his second horse, to cross the
Skögadals river. It was thought we should have had his
services for the best part of the day.</p>

<p>Ole asked our carrier to give us another hour which
would make what he considered the value of the dollar,
but the man would not go any farther; an extra mark
would not tempt him. He had come eleven miles; one
of his horse’s shoes was loose. Our gipsies thought he
should have continued until one o’clock. Lending the
man our hammer, and axe, to fasten the horse shoe on,
which was much too small, we paid him his six marks.
Advancing towards us in a solemn manner, he shook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
hands, and with his horse rather lame, he went off at the
same regulated steady pace. If intelligence had been
suddenly brought that the Skögadals sœter, had been
burnt down, and his tall wife in it, we do not think he
would have gone one step faster towards the scene of
conflagration.</p>

<p>Noah! Zachariah! let the donkeys be loaded. Esmeralda
clears our dinner service into the kettle bag. Ole is up
and stirring; we are soon off at ten minutes past one
o’clock. Our party was soon over the ridge; a long
stony valley lay before us beneath the rugged steeps of
the Melkedalstinderne. The donkeys did their best
with their loads; the lift with the carrier’s horse in the
morning, had been very useful. Ole had evidently
resolved to make a determined push towards Eisbod.
Many swift, but shallow streams coming from the glaciers
above, were crossed without difficulty. With some perseverance
the Melkedals vand<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> is reached; it is called the
œvre vand or upper lake. A still dark lake, nothing
but masses of loose rocks for its shores. Ole said there
were no fish in it. How we made our way over the loose
masses of stone on the left bank, from one end to the
other, is a marvel, sometimes up, sometimes down, with
often nothing, but pointed rocks, for our loaded animals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
to stand upon. Noah did his best. At last the Puru
Rawnee slipped with her load, and fell with her legs
between the rocks. We were much afraid she would
break or cut her legs all to pieces. She was quickly
unloaded. By good fortune our handsome Puru Rawnee,
had not broken any bones; the hair was bruised off in
some places; she was able to go on. Quickly reloading
again, we were thankful to leave the desolate shores of
the Melkedals vand, still struggling on step, by step, with
our tired animals; at length we reached a small wild
mountain tarn. At one place we crossed the track of a
reindeer; time was fast fleeting towards night, we could not
very well camp where we were, nothing but rocky steeps,
and loose masses of stone on every side, not a blade of
grass to be seen for our donkeys. Leaving the lonely
tarn we came to a mountain stream. Our route now
became very steep, often down loose masses of rock.
Ole and ourself had to lead the way, and occasionally
form a rough road, or form steps with loose fragments of
rock, to enable our animals to proceed. All the care of
our gipsies was necessary. A false step by either of the
donkeys would probably disable it for further exertion.
At some places we had to pile up masses of stone for a
considerable height, to enable the donkeys to descend
the rough, and broken declivities of rock. Slowly and
cheerfully we made our way, everyone doing his best.
Now and then some small streams of water had to be
crossed. Coming down a steep declivity we at length
came in sight of the waters of the Melkedals, “Nedre
Vand,” or the Lower Lake.</p>

<p>As the shades of night were fast descending, we reached
the lake, and making our way slowly along the left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
bank, we halted on a slope, close to the shore of the
lake. There was a semblance of green; just enough
blades of grass, to enable us to fancy we were on turf.
Seeing nothing but loose rocks beyond, we decided to stay.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the gipsies, “where’s the fire?”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_411" src="images/i_411.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MELKEDALS, NEDRE VAND.</p></div>

<p>“Ah,” said Ole, “perhaps you can do without one
this evening, or we will go on if you like.”</p>

<p>We determined to stay.</p>

<p>“It is uncertain,” said Ole, “if we come to any
better camping-ground.”</p>

<p>Zachariah, who was always foremost in settling all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
matters, had first to be extinguished before we could
light our camp fire at the Nedre Vand.</p>

<p>“Fire,” said we; “some fuel shall be found somewhere&mdash;warm
tea we will have.”</p>

<p>The donkeys were soon relieved of their burthens. It
is astonishing how soon men accustomed to camp life
in the mountains, quickly avail themselves of all material.
With a few roots, and some dry turf, our water soon
boiled over a camp fire. We had never failed during
our campaign. There is, besides, something very cheerful
in seeing your fire in the shades of evening, on the
shore of a lake. Our spirits were soon as gay as usual.
After our tea, fladbröd and butter, Ole made himself comfortable
under a rock. First, putting up some sods with
a spade; then placing a large flat piece of turf, and
stunted juniper roots above, Ole slipped himself under,
and wrapping a handkerchief, and his bag of pig’s
bristles round his neck and head, with our waterproof
over all, was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Ole said we had travelled about seventeen miles from
Skögadal sœter. At one time just before tea, Ole
went up the ridge beyond our camp, to examine the
way. He thought he heard a rifle shot, and might meet
some reindeer hunters.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night; we stood on the
shores of the lake after all had gone to rest. There was
our sleeping guide under his rock. There our sleeping
gipsies ’neath their tents; near our camp our three
gallant merles. They had indeed fought their way well
for us; nor did we forget to caress them sometimes.
The Puru Rawnee had to be bathed occasionally with
a little weak brandy and water; sometimes to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
strengthened up with a little bruise mixture; biscuit, and
now and then a piece of bread, also fell to their share.</p>

<p>Beyond a picturesque island on the other shore, we
could see a large glacier stretching apparently into the
very waters of the lake.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> How beautiful in the moonlight
below those wild peaks. There were some dark
crevasses to be seen on the glacier’s surface. At times,
in the stillness of the night, we could hear that sound
peculiar to glaciers, a loud cracking noise, which echoed
across the waters to our camp.</p>

<p>Up at half-past three o’clock. Zachariah! Vand!
water! yog! fire! now quick, Noah! Our gipsies are
up. Ole is up, of course. We saw him to bed, or we
should think he sat up over night to be ready. Tea,
fladbröd, and our last tin of potted meat, for breakfast.
Tents struck; all moving along the slope from the lake
at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>We slowly make our way over loose stones, and a
mountain ridge is soon gained. We commence our
descent towards the Lake Bygdin far below us. Descending
carefully down a snow slope, we crossed a
wild torrent. Sometime afterwards we reached the left
slopes of Melkedalen, between the Grava Fjeld and
Slaataafjeld. Still continuing our descent of Melkedalen,
we reached the shores of a lake.</p>

<p>As we came in sight of this long, and beautiful lake,
Ole pointed out the “Poet’s House” on a bold promontory.
At the head of the lake we could perceive it.
It has just the appearance of a newly-built châlet, or
sœter; something lonely and picturesque in its position.
Its association with poetry gave it a further charm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<p>We were still at some distance from the “Poet’s House.”
Ole signalled for a boat. In the distance we could see
some figures near the house, apparently watching our
party. They were probably puzzled, as to who we could
be, issuing forth in early morning, from the wild recesses,
of Melkedalstinderne.</p>

<p>Two boats came to the shore where we were. All our
baggage was placed in one; we handed Esmeralda into
the other. Ole, Noah, and Zachariah started off on the
donkeys to ford the river, and round the upper bend of
the lake to the “Poet’s House.”</p>

<p>The boats glided on the smooth water of the lake.
The sun gilded the lofty mountains on either shore; all
quietude, peace, and contentment. The Norwegian poet
has well chosen, thought we, this charming seclusion
from the world.</p>

<p>Our boats rounded the promontory past the “châlet.”
Two ladies, and three gentlemen were near it; some were
seated, watching us as we came near. They were making
use of a large telescope.</p>

<p>Our boatmen landed at some little distance past the
“Poet’s House” on the beach of the promontory,&mdash;a sort
of inland bay. As we came to the shore, we noticed
a man seated near a hut, whisking a leafy branch
over some dark looking pieces of meat, hanging from a
line. We afterwards found it was rein-deer meat, being
dried in the sun. The man was keeping the flies off,
while the meat was being dried for future consumption.</p>

<p>Our baggage was all safely deposited on a pleasant
slope of ground, not far from the rein-deer hunter’s hut.
We had a good View of the “Poet’s House.” Ole, and
Noah, and Zachariah soon joined us. Our boatmen were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
well satisfied with one mark. Noah and Zachariah had
got their legs wet in crossing the river, but Ole had the
forethought to take off his stockings, before he rode into
the stream.</p>

<p>The history of the “Poet’s House” appeared to be as
follows:&mdash;The wooden cottage, which consists of two
small rooms only, cost 100 dollars, Norwegian money, or
about 20<i>l.</i> English. The poet, Aasmund Olafsen Vinje,
joined with others in the cost of erection. When the
poet was required to pay 25 dollars, his stipulated share,
he was unable to do so. He had certainly more than
25 pence, but he could only spare 5 dollars. This was
certainly better than the man who owed 465<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and offered his creditor the 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Poets, somehow, are
seldom wealthy. We have occasionally bright exceptions.
Vinje was not one. To release the poet from
his difficulty, it was agreed that he should mortgage his
interest in the house, and write a mortgage in poetry for
the sum. Vinje did this. The mortgage deed in poetry,
will ever remain, a curious, and interesting association,
with the “Poet’s House” on the Bygdin lake.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>Our experience does not enable us to give a single
instance of any of the English lawyers writing a
mortgage in poetry. The only instance we know of any
legal document being written in poetry, in England, is
the will of Sir Willoughby Dixon, of Bosworth Park,
Leicestershire. It was written by himself. United to
the refinement of the scholar, there is often a sharp,
sound, practical hitting the-right-nail-on-the-head sort of
ability, among the country gentry of England. A manly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
vigour of intellect, united to an intense love of honourable
dealing, and fair play, in all the affairs of life.</p>

<p>A rein-deer hunter, a friend of Ole’s, soon afterwards
came to us. He was a tall, spare, keen man, and brought
some rein-deer meat up in a small wooden tub. We
were afraid to buy more than one piece; the weather
was hot, and the meat would not keep long. Another
reason for not buying more rein-deer meat was, our
chance of obtaining fish at the Tyen Lake, which we
expected to reach the same afternoon. Our fire was
soon lighted. One of the gentlemen from the “Poet’s
House” came up. The gipsies were very busy preparing
our dinner. A young Norwegian gentleman, who wore
a uniform tunic and trousers of green cloth, came to our
camp. He was fair and prepossessing. Amiability was
written in his countenance, without looking in his hand.
He spoke some English. After our meal, it was arranged
we should pay himself and friends a visit at the “Poet’s
House,” where they were staying. Tea, fried rein-deer,
pickled walnuts, and fladbröd, formed our repast. A
short man, in a leather jacket, trousers, and cap, came up,
and we paid him sixteen skillings for the rein-deer meat.</p>

<p>Skeaker was before us. Resolving in our mind to go
without our gipsies to the “Poet’s House,” we left them
to pack up and load the donkeys, whilst we went with
Ole to visit the poet’s retreat.</p>

<p>The châlet is built of logs, on a rising point of land, at
the head of the lake. The first of the two rooms it contained,
had a fireplace for cooking, and two boarded
bedsteads, not unlike “bunks,” but more finished, and
elaborate. The room had also one window, which would
not open. A door gave entrance to the inner room, also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
provided with two similar bedsteads. The inner chamber
was occupied by the ladies, and had only one window,
which apparently did not open for ventilation. A
beautiful bouquet of wild flowers, stood upon the room
table; all was order and neatness. How soon we
distinguished the female hand, in domestic arrangement.</p>

<p>The view from the châlet was a scene of enchantment,
as we looked in the glorious midday sun, over the distant
expanse of lake. On the left shore of the lake, rise the
mountains of the Grava Fjeld, Galdeberg, the lofty
Sletmarkhö, and the Svartdalspiggne. Again, to our
right, rise the wild mountain ranges of the Dryllenöset,
Volaahornene, and Oxendalsnöset, the home of the rein-deer,
the eagle, the wolf, and the bear.</p>

<p>The visitors at the “Poet’s House” appeared to do
everything for themselves. They had, no doubt, their
commissariat, like ourselves. The young ladies were very
agreeable, and good looking. We were told they were
the daughters of a banker. The elder gentleman of the
party, who spoke a little English, pointed out some old
Norwegian poetry, written in pencil, on the inner room
door. They had been staying at the châlet about eight
days. Often, in after life, shall we remember our
pleasant visit, to the “Poet’s House,” on the beautiful
Lake Bygdin.</p>

<p>On our return to our party, we found Noah had broken
his Alpine stock. Zachariah had commenced fishing in
the lake, but was referred by some man to a stream near,
which Zachariah alleged was destitute of fish. Esmeralda
was short and chaffy.</p>

<p>One rein-deer hunter, made a start for the mountains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
with the telescope. We were told that it belonged to
Prœsten Halling, who seemed either in person, name,
or belongings, to be everywhere. The rein-deer hunter
swung off at a jaunty pace, as if he would make short
work of the very steep mountain before him. Ole said
he was going to look out for rein-deer.</p>

<p>The party from the “Poet’s House” came up to see
us off. They seemed interested in our equipment. We
also showed the young ladies our guitar. A copy of
our song, had previously been given to one of the
party. With very little delay, we hastened away from
this region of poetry. Esmeralda was getting impetuous.
Even the donkeys, after all their mishaps during the
previous day, were eager to proceed on the journey.
With many adieux to the very pleasant visitors at
the “Poet’s House” we left Eisbod, and the Bygdin
Lake.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Esmeralda was very determined, stepping after the
baggage, as only a gipsy can step. Ole, of course,
leads the way. Three merles loaded, Noah and Zachariah,
and then Esmeralda, and then ourselves.</p>

<p>Esmeralda had been very quick in movement, up and
down, and everywhere, with now and then, something
to say. We were thankful when we were removed, with
this restless orbit of our wanderings, from the “Poet’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
House.” Yet she said soon afterwards, she had only
pretended to be offended, we must think nothing of it.
We were on the eve of fresh scenes, why should we
remember a slight ripple on the glittering surface of
the waters of Lake Bygdin.

<p>Eisbod, on Lake Bygdin, had been left at one o’clock.
The Lake Tyen was soon reached. The Lake Bygdin
is said to be 17½ English miles long, Lake Tyen about
12 miles. The evening was beautiful when we reached
Lake Tyen. Our route lay along its left shore nearly
the whole length of the lake.</p>

<p>After we had journeyed some short distance, following
the narrow footpath or rough track, we reached
Tvindehougen.</p>

<p>This is also a wooden châlet, on a rise of ground
above the lake, erected, we were told, at the cost of
the “Norwegian Tourist Club” for their accommodation
in summer. The cost, we were told, was 100 dollars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
equivalent to about 20<i>l.</i> The sketch of the châlet we
then made is given below, with a view of the lake, and
the Koldedalstinderne (peaks of the cold valley).<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p class="caption">NORWEGIAN TOURIST CLUB CHÂLET.</p></div>

<p>Ole shouted to some fishermen at “Fiskebod,” on the
other side of the lake. It was expected they would bring
some fish. One man came in his boat after we had waited
quite a quarter of an hour. Ole was disappointed to find
he had brought no fish. It occurred to us we should have
to pay him after calling him over: a glass of aquavitæ
settled matters to his satisfaction. There were two men
at the “Tourists’ Châlet.” One was a tall thin fellow,
draped in leather, and nothing else&mdash;coat, breeches,
stockings, and a sort of skin shoe. The châlet consists
of two rooms, with superior kind of “bunks,” or bedsteads,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
but no fittings of any kind. The windows are
too low to obtain a pleasant view of the lake when
standing up, and are not adapted for ventilation.
Travellers staying at the châlet must take everything
with them, including bedding, &amp;c. There is a stove in
one room. We must, of course, consider that this châlet
of the Norwegian club, is only intended for summer
residence. Travellers who avail themselves of its accommodation,
must be mountaineers. It is a shelter
from the storm, wind, and night-air, and is not intended
for anything more. The evening was warm and sultry;
at the same time we enjoyed the summer’s sun, as we
made our way, as best we could, along the narrow
broken track.</p>

<p>Except ourself, all the party were very thirsty; even
Ole, seldom troubled with thirst, made frequent visits to
the clear rippling mountain streams, which often crossed
our path.</p>

<p>At evening close, we reached a green, pleasant slope,
below a rising bank, covered with juniper bushes, and
very near a shingly beach on the lake.</p>

<p>We were within five or ten minutes of the time, Ole
predicted we should reach the sœter of Lortwick. The
name, Ole said, meant dirty. Not from the state of the
sœter, but from the prevailing bad weather of that part
of the lake. If we could judge from the outside of the
sœter, it might also have suited the name.</p>

<p>At first the gipsies did not see any dry fire-wood.
“Go to the shingly beach,” said we, “you will find
plenty.” There is always some rough wood, drifted up
by high winds on every beach. They found plenty, and
we had a good fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span></p>

<p>What is that we hear, as Noah is putting up the
tents? Esmeralda’s voice to her brother Zachariah,
in severe reproof&mdash;“Push it on, Highflyer.&mdash;What,
pushing the prop the wrong way. Oh, Lucas! Lucas!
you were always a mumper!”</p>

<p>We had tea, fladbröd, and butter, for our aftens-mad,
Ole afterwards went to the sœter, and had their iron
pot cleaned out for gröd in the morning.</p>

<p>Noah produced a meerschaum pipe, and began to
smoke. What camp rules&mdash;smoking! Noah was, upon
explanation, found to have picked it up at a spring, and
said he was only drawing out the contents of the tobacco
in it, to empty it. He very soon put it up. After reflection&mdash;Why
are thoughtless tourists so careless, as
to leave their pipes about, to the serious injury, and
temptation of our gipsies?</p>

<p>Just as we were retiring to bed, Esmeralda thought
she heard a toad creaking&mdash;didn’t like it. As far as
we could ascertain, it was her brother Zachariah, who
was fast asleep in bed snoring.</p>

<p>Up at half-past three O’clock; a very cold morning;
there is a wintry feeling about the air. To-day is
Wednesday, the 10th August, yet, after all, we can
stand without inconvenience, the chilliness of an early
sunrise in the mountains. The view was beautiful, as the
sun rose beyond the lake, over the sharp peaks of Koldedalstinderne.
We went to the Lortwick sœter. Ole was
of course up. Does he sit up all night? was a question,
we again asked. He had got the iron pot full of water
ready to boil. When we returned Noah was sent for the
gröd. How we enjoyed, notwithstanding the extreme
freshness of the morning, a summer’s day iced, as we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
our matutinal splash in the lake. Noah soon brought the
gröd to the tents; Ole joined us, and we had our breakfast.
Gröd and milk is certainly a cheap meal, sufficient
for five people scarcely exceeds the cost of ten
skillings. We found the gröd very good for hard work;
our cost at the Lortwick sœter was&mdash;</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning, we passed the Lortwick
sœter on the Tyen Vand. Esmeralda and Noah
had evidently got up on the wrong side the turf.</p>

<p>The Lake Tyen is picturesque, but not so wild as
the Lake Bygdin. Time did not permit us to test
the fishing. The view, especially from the “Tourist’s
Châlet,” Tvindehougen, is very picturesque. On the opposite
shore there are generally some Norwegian fishermen,
at a place called Fiskebod.</p>

<p>As we left the shores of the lake, the gipsy storm rose
higher; the hurricane of human intellect was even too
great for Zachariah to swim in&mdash;Mephistopheles kept
aloof with his donkey, as a mariner shuns a maëlstrom.
Even Ole pushed ahead some yards farther than usual,
not altogether out of reach of the wordy projectiles, which
fell around.</p>

<p>We were used to it&mdash;ours was a kind of charmed life;
it is marvellous how we sometimes escaped. Fancy the
melancholy termination of our career, as a wandering
gipsy, on the shores of the Tyen Vand.</p>

<p>The Birmingham bagman would have lost two copies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
of this work. The fate of the English gipsies in Norway,
would have remained an impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p>Esmeralda, as we passed the Lortwick sœter, would
now and then advance rapidly from the rear, and fire
a heavy broadside into Noah. The Romany chaff was
very severe on both sides. “Isn’t Ambrose a balloshero?
Oh, yes, Ambrose is like varnon, when he
rockers like a galdering gorgio. Ambrose can talk,
can’t he? The mumply dinlo! What a state he puts
himself in, over everybody else.”</p>

<p>Noah was by no means wanting in ammunition. When
Esmeralda fell back to the rear, we did our best to
keep her there. Noah kept a running fire all the time.
The tall gipsy kept his temper very well, except when
severely hit, by some more than usually sarcastic
allusion.</p>

<p>Leaving the lake, we passed down a narrow gorge.
At the head of this gorge, Esmeralda again brought
up all her reserve of the Romany artillery. Uncle
Elijah was brought up, knocked down, and killed ten
times over.</p>

<p>How well we remember the tall active form of the
gipsy girl, rapidly bringing up her merle and baggage
from the rear, her eyes flashing with indignant fire&mdash;poor
Noah&mdash;what will be his fate? The battle of
Dorking was nothing to it. Noah stands firm. He
takes advantage of the intricacy of the narrow pathway;
the broken nature of the ground separates their
forces. Ole, we see, is still alive; a stray shot is only
heard now and then.</p>

<p>Again we had calm, and quiet, on the horizon. Shortly
after coming forth from the defile, we halt. Our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
donkeys are unloaded on the summit of a lofty slope.
At a short distance from us there is a sœter. Below, at
the bottom of the valley across a small river, we see the
Bergen road. The gipsies had had their say. No one
had any conception, or they themselves, what it was all
about. An exhaustion of superabundant animal energy,
and intense physical force. All was forgotten. A fire
was quickly lighted in the now warm sunshine. Ole and
ourselves were now to part. The middags-mad consisted
of fried English ham, vinegar, fladbröd, butter,
ovensbröd, and tea. Ole was delighted with our tea.
He carefully measured the tin pannikin we had given
him to use. Ole always had the same. Noah said he
knew it by a dinge on the side. Our guide said he
should have one made like it. All our camp arrangements
had, apparently, much interested Ole. Mountaineers
are naturally interested in the most portable, and
convenient methods, of affording food and shelter, in those
regions where accommodation is scanty and uncertain.
There was very little that we had not provided; scarcely
any addition necessary, beyond those things we had
already brought. Such was the practical result of our
camp experience.</p>

<p>After our middags-mad, slightly tinged perhaps with a
shade of melancholy, we strolled aside with Ole. The
cost of Ole’s services amounted to eight specie dollars,
calculated at the rate of four marks a day, and including
his return allowance. Our coat, lost on the Galdhöpiggen,
was to be sent by parcel post if found. The postage
would be twelve skillings per pound, and we gave him
one mark twelve shillings.</p>

<p>Ole said he hoped to see us again; we hoped so too.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
With unfeigned regret we parted with our gallant
Ole Halvorsen, of Rödsheim. Always punctual, even-tempered,
and ever anxious to save us any unnecessary
expense; possessed of much practical experience of a
large region of wild country; ready to camp out on the
mountain side without a tent; undaunted in the hour of
difficulty; never at fault, quick in expedients, cool and
calm; of few words, but full of information; we pay
this parting tribute to our excellent Ole Halvorsen.</p>

<p>Ole said he had never fared so well in the mountains.
It was a compliment to our cook and commissariat.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Ambrose, good-by, Miss daughter,
and master Zâkēē,” said Ole.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Rödsheim,” said our gipsies as we
shook hands, and with our parting farewell, and good
wishes, Ole was soon far up the mountain side.</p>

<p>Our donkeys were already loaded. In a very short
time we had crossed the river, and had reached the
Bergen road. Our party came forth from the deep
recesses of the Horungerne mountains with new energy;
issuing forth, as it were, from the vast wilderness of
peak, glacier, lake, and river, to the civilized world.
The distance to Christiania was yet considerable; the
time we could allow ourselves was short; the summer
fast waning, yet we had gathered renewed energy. Our
donkeys pricked their ears when they found themselves
on the hard road. Nothing could exceed the health
and spirits of our party. A few forced marches would
accomplish all we required. Mephistopheles said it could
not be done in the time, and was quickly snuffed out.</p>

<p>It is necessary to push on in this world. Splangy
when he goes out to hunt, will always be in somewhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
It is true his weight may be a stone or two more than
his hunter can well carry. It is equally certain that
Splangy’s mare is disinclined to jump if it can bore
through a fence. If she stumbles into the first ditch,
Splangy tumbles into the second. Still Splangy never
looses the reins; he pulls through, and is always in
somewhere.</p>

<p>Then there are Johnson and Toboys, men of business.
Johnson is said to sleep with one eye open, and Toboys
never sleeps at all. They have business all over the
world. For instance, when an order is given, it is sent
in to the day. It is pushed through. The set of chairs
are in the drawing-room, never mind if the owner, a few
days afterwards, sits on one with a defective leg, and is
flat on the floor, with the chair upon him. He is painfully
reminded of Johnson and Toboys’ address. Well,
after all, says he, they were delivered in time for me to
receive the Prussian Ambassador. With many other
firms, says the owner, I should have had to wait two
years, when the chintz would be faded, and the fashion
gone. Johnson and Toboys, of course, get the order for
his dining-room. The furniture van dashes up; all is
delivered on the day. What matter if one chair is
afterwards discovered legless. Ah! says the owner,
holding it up, it is well cushioned, and comfortable.
What matter if, forgetting the legs, he sits down, turning
an acrobatic back-somersault in the air? Carpets are
thick now-a-days; no bones are broken. The owner is
only painfully reminded of Johnson and Toboys’ address.
Never mind, says the owner, after all, they were in time
for me to receive my friend Fitful and his wife from
India. It soon turns out the workman who had the legs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
had no head; they were only forgotten. Johnson and
Toboys have made their fortune, whilst some firms are
thinking about it. Let us push on.</p>

<p>The Bergen road was reached by our party, at a point
between Nystuen and Skogstad. The trout of Nystuen
are said to be exceedingly good. We were at the foot of
the Fille Fjeld. The scenery was charming as we
followed the road down to Skogstad; all down hill, and
an excellent road. Groves of birch, mountain willow,
and alder trees, alternating with rock scenes, and fir
wood. The Findal’s Horn rises to our right. Allons
donc! How gaily the Puru Rawnee, with her jingling
bells stepped out; ever leading; head well up, as if in
her pride, she knew she was always admired. We shall
never see another donkey like her; such fine long legs,
clean, and admirably shaped, stepping under her heavy
load, as if it was nothing. <i>Allons donc!</i> as we rapidly
followed the winding road, and our party soon reached
Skogstad Station. We had parted from Ole at the
sœter, at twenty minutes past twelve o’clock, and
reached Skogstad at half-past one. In we went to get
some fladbröd. Whilst the pige was getting the fladbröd,
we went into a very small comfortable side room. Seeing
a curiously inlaid violin hanging up, we asked the pige
the price. She brought the master of the station; he
called the ostler. It now appeared the ostler was a
fabricator of violins; a musical genius. The short old
man, who wore breeches on very bow legs, reached out
another violin from a cupboard. This was of more recent
manufacture, and far better tone. The station-master,
who was a very pleasant obliging man, prevailed on the
ostler to play a tune. “An ancient Norwegian air,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
the station-master. We can only say the composer must
have been far from lively at the time of composition.
The old man sawed away in a slow methodical manner.
As contrasted with our camp music, it was lugubrious.
How delighted Ole Bull, the celebrated Norwegian violinist,
would have been with his countryman’s performance.
Mephistopheles was nearly in a fit. We ordered a bottle
of excellent ale, and gave the ostler a glass to drink gamle
norge. The ostler had exhausted his inspiration, and
the ale had no reviving effect. The gipsies and myself,
therefore, finished the rest. Ah! what about strict
camp rules? We are not in camp, we are in the
Skogstad Station. Then Mephistopheles played some
rather stirring airs on the new violin and the old one.
We understood it was one of the Hardanger violins, and
asked the price. The station-master and the two pige
stood by, whilst Mephistopheles played. Then the
station-master said, “English,” and smiled. The ostler
wanted three dollars. We were considering, trying,
discussing, when up drove some carrioles to the station;
English travellers in knickerbockers. Out went the old
ostler; out went the station-master. We paid the pige
for the fladbröd and öl. Noah took the Hardanger
violin, if it was one, under his arm. The ostler was outside,
standing by the pony of the first carriole just put in.
We handed three paper dollars to the old man. “Fire,”
said the old fellow, showing four fingers. “Nei! Nei!”
said Noah. “No,” said we, finding the old man had
suddenly raised his price. “Tre,” and we put out our
hand with our three dollars. The two young girls were
close by him with anxious countenances, evidently
expecting we should give up the purchase.

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_431" src="images/i_431.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE NORWEGIAN VIOLIN.</p></div>

<p>The scene was famous, Skogstad Station, and its
picturesque scenery. Carrioles before the entrance with
ponies just put in, and ponies just taken out. Jolly
station-master; English travellers in knickerbockers just
getting into carrioles. Two rather pretty Norwegian
girls standing beside the old ostler; old ostler, the
picture of irresolution. His melancholy countenance,
expressing anxiety to get one dollar more. Esmeralda at
our elbow, telling us not to let the gorgio do Mandy.
Her tall gipsy brother waiting for the ancient violin,
Mephistopheles saying: “Maw kin the Bosh, sir, if he
don’t lel the three dollars.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> We were just going off; the
old man suddenly clutched the three dollar notes. Noah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
quickly placed the ancient violin and bow under his
arm. Away we went from the road side scene, and soon
joined our animals and baggage.</p>

<p>The violin as represented still remains a souvenir of
Skogstad.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we left, when a tall powerful man, in
breeches, came running after us in breathless haste; taking
off his hat, we found he wished to see the donkeys;
staying a few moments to gratify his curiosity, he exclaimed
many times Peen giœre!!! peen giœre!! “Ya, ya,”
said Noah, and we again continued our journey, wishing
him god morgen.

<p>A wild river on the left of the road soon found its
outlet in a small lake. A man and woman, in a boat
upon the lake, were fishing with a net; soon afterwards
we came to Oye on the “Lille Mjösen Vand.” We
purchased five eggs at a house near the road, for five
skillings; and the young Norwegian girl showed us a
curious violin they had in the house. The Lille Mjösen
is a very beautiful and picturesque lake; the road lay
through wooded slopes, on the right bank, steep rocky
cliffs towered above us. Before reaching Tune, we came
to a charming grassy knoll, immediately above the road;
the small stony gully, on one side, was convenient for the
donkeys to graze. A large forest of spruce fir surrounded
the knoll on all sides, except towards the road, below
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
which the stony shingly shore of the lake extended;
above the forest slope were some lofty picturesque rocks.
From the knoll, we had a delightful view across the
lake, which was not very broad at this part. On the
opposite shore, the Skjyri Fjeld rose in very lofty steeps,
almost immediately from the waters of the lake. We
noticed also, on the other side, one small gaard, lonely by
itself, on a narrow slip of reclaimed land, a few acres,
between the water, and the base of the precipice, which
rose almost straight to lofty summits, covered here and
there by fir wood.</p>

<p>Our knoll was delightfully shut in and secluded; the
lofty trees of the spruce fir stretched to the base of the
cliff above. So steep were they, that verdure could not
exist. Although only four o’clock, the camp ground was
so tempting, we determined to halt. Noah and Zachariah
fished in the lake without success. The evening was
very warm and sunny. Our aftens-mad consisted of tea,
fladbröd, eggs, and butter.</p>

<p>At the Skogstad Station, we had had one mark’s worth
of fladbröd, and the bottle of ale cost twelve skillings, the
usual price. Our violin three dollars, the price at first
asked. A few carrioles passed underneath during the
evening, but the travellers did not observe us. Our
music in the stillness of evening sounded across the lake,
In the dim light, we could see a fire on the other shore.
The evenings now get more damp, night begins sooner.
Quite late, as Noah was putting up our tent, a Stolkjœre
came by; the traveller pulled up, and, to our surprise,
we again met our acquaintance of the Bygdin Lake,
the young gentleman who wore the uniform tunic. We
welcomed him as an old friend; he said he had come to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
certain point on the route with the ladies, and they had
met Ole. Our friend said he had parted from the other
visitors we met at the “Poet’s House,” and hoped to be
in Christiania on Sunday. We gave him one of our best
cigars, which he said were not often met with in the
mountains. A short chat, of course, about the war, and
we parted, probably to meet again in Christiania.</p>

<p>Near our tents there was an exceedingly large nest of
creas (gip., ants), as my people called them. Their communistic
ideas were at once apparent; they swarmed
about our camp, taking away all they could carry.</p>

<p>They had three large tracks diverging from their nest
to the road, down which thousands were hastily hurrying
to and fro; it was very interesting to watch them.
Nature has an ever-varied, and instructive page to set
before you at every step.</p>

<p>Going out of our tents the last thing, we were astounded
at what we saw by the camp fire. The appearance of a
Huldre (fairy), or a Jotul (giant), could not have astonished
us more. Noah was seated, and actually smoking a
pipe; it was as the French say, “un peu trop fort,”
camp rules infringed, laws broken, what next? we of
course spoke upon the subject.</p>

<p>We shall not trouble our readers with our Nicotian
lecture. It was in vain Noah advanced that smoking
was better than chewing; we were firm. He had given
his word, knew the camp rules, and we could not have
any future confidence in any man who broke his word
with us. Noah, with a melancholy look, slowly put out
his pipe, and it disappeared. “You shall not say I am a
liar, sir; I shall keep my word, as I have promised.” After
all, Noah, in his wild way, is not a bad fellow; he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
been thrown into all kinds of temptation, without care,
or instruction of any sort, leading a wild wandering life,
yet, throughout our campaign, we never heard him once
utter an oath. It is more than we can say with regard
to many others we have met, persons more educated, and
with better opportunities. Yes, Noah is tolerably steady;
notwithstanding, a few cigars, and a little brandy, might
be much imperilled if placed in his way. We must
however give Noah his due, to us he was ever ready to do
his share in the rough work of our Norwegian wanderings.
We must ever take an interest in Noah’s fate.</p>

<p>It is Thursday the 11th of August, the morning is very
fine, our party up at twenty minutes past four o’clock.
Our fladbröd was exhausted; nineteen college biscuits
were allowed to each, with butter and tea for breakfast.
The morning was cold till we had the sun upon the
valley. The Lille Mjösen is a charming lake. Our
party were soon off.</p>

<p>We had not long left our camp, when we met a
gentleman carrying an umbrella to shade himself from
the morning sun. He was a Norwegian clergyman, who
spoke English very well, and had been staying with an
English family in Christiania. Evincing much interest
in our expedition, he kindly gave us some very useful
suggestions with regard to our future route. The route
he suggested as best suited for camping purposes, and as
also being very picturesque, was <i>viâ</i> Krœmmermoen, the
Spirilen Lake and the Krogkleven. When he left us to
continue his walk, we immediately afterwards reached
an inn, which appeared very comfortable; several
travellers were staying there. They were attired in their
best wearing apparel, and were evidently enjoying a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
summer tour. We tried to get some Kagebröd; all they
could offer us were some very seedy pieces of bread, rather
mouldy, and one piece of fladbröd, which Noah could have
demolished at a mouthful. The bread we left, but a
pound of fresh butter, at twenty-two skillings, we took
with us.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a man came running after us in
breathless haste; our donkeys were the object of attraction;
great was his admiration before he left us.</p>

<p>In a roadside churchyard we soon after passed, we
believe it was Vang, there is a singular stone, carved with
an interesting relief, and an inscription.</p>

<p>In some churchyards we passed in Norway, a mere
cross of wood marks the grave. Now and then we
observed a railing round a grave, and occasionally, but
very seldom, a marble head-stone, with an inscription.
Then we came to birch woods, and a beautiful road along
the side of the lake. Sometimes, as we journeyed close
to the water edge, shaded by lofty rocks, our gipsies, as
they caught sight of the large trout, would exclaim&mdash;“Dawdy,
what a borrieck matcho!”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>In the Lille Mjosen, we observed nets set with floats.
Spruce fir is the predominant tree of this district. The
scenery is very beautiful; wood, mountain, rock, and
water in great perfection.</p>

<p>Our gipsies pushed the donkeys on rapidly; some-
times on the trot. About one o’clock we saw to the right
of the road “Öiloe Station.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span></p>

<p>We were delighted with the scenery of this place.
Sending Esmeralda and Zachariah on with the baggage,
with instructions to halt at the first convenient place, we
went with Noah up the road to the station.</p>

<p>We had to forage for bread. The mistress of the
station, a portly good-natured woman, looked out of an
upstairs window, as we came up. When we entered the
old house, we were surprised to meet our friend, from the
“Poet’s House,” at the Bydgin Lake. It seems he was
waiting for a carriole to take him on. Through his kind
assistance, the mistress spared us part of a loaf, six eggs,
and some fladbröd, for sixteen skillings. Noah at once
took possession of the provisions.</p>

<p>The mistress, who was a fine-looking woman, possessing
some remains of former beauty, took us upstairs. It was
a sort of large guest room, with two windows, and three
or four beds. The station seemed to have been a perfect
nest of artists. We were not surprised. The scenery
around was lovely. Not that it was as impressive, as
that we had lately left; but all the elements which
entrance, and captivate the mind, of those who seek
nature, were there. The artists had left their marks.
One artist of the name of Lorck, had, on the morning of
his departure, painted his watch on the wall, above the
head of his bed. When he had left, the pige, thinking
he had forgotten it, attempted to take it down. Another
had painted a key on the wall, almost, if not quite equal
to the one on the wall of Wiertz’s celebrated, and singular
Musée at Bruxelles. There was also a landscape scene
painted on the wall, of another part of the room, over one
of the beds.</p>

<p>Of course the pencil of an industrious countryman was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
busy- “W.J. Phillips, Prestwich, 20-7-70.” Then we
were shown a small likeness of Eckersberg the artist,
which represented him as dressed in a red coat; the
portrait had been painted by himself. We were told he
had died three weeks before our visit, and the artist
would never again visit the scenes which had afforded so
many subjects for his pencil.</p>

<p>Then the hostess produced two girdles for sale, the
owners being poor and wanting money. We at last
bought one of the girdles as a souvenir&mdash;a Norwegian
maiden’s girdle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_439" src="images/i_439.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NORWEGIAN MAIDEN’S BELT, ÖILOE.</p></div>

<p>An engraving is now given of the belt. The ornaments
and fastening are all in brass. The only similar belt we
saw in Norway, was worn by the little dark woman, who
visited our tents at Laugaard.</p>

<p>The hostess afterwards brought us some milk, for which
she would not make any charge. In fact, our Bygdin
friend, the hostess, ourself, and Noah, had quite a
delightful conversazione. Vague news was of course
given about the war.</p>

<p>When we had just descended the extremely primitive
stairs, and were going out of the door, the husband met
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
us. He gave a sort of suppressed shriek, when he saw
Noah with the provisions. Our friend from the Bygdin
Lake, and the man’s tall wife, said some words to him.
Noah had certainly not taken the watch and key painted
on the guest-room wall. Whatever they said, the effect
was magical; the husband disappeared. With kindly
salutations, we left the abode of artists.</p>

<p>What a charming spot Esmeralda had selected for the
mid-day’s halt, at a short distance from the station,
where the road traversed some new-mown, parky-looking
ground, open to the road; they had unloaded near a
clump of trees.</p>

<p>The river from the Lille Mjösen Lake, broken into
picturesque rapids, was close to us. Esmeralda was
seated midst the baggage, and the donkeys were grazing
near. Zachariah was at once started to fish for the
commissariat, and afterwards returned with seven
delicious trout; one was a very fine one, one foot three
inches long; beautifully pink. For our middags-mad,
we had eggs, potatoes, fladbröd, and cheese. Our friend
from the Bygdin Lake, soon after passed along the road,
<i>en route</i> to Christiania, and waved his <i>adieux</i>. Several
carrioles and carriages passed along the road towards
Bergen. Some were apparently English travellers, and
seemed rather astonished to see a party of gipsies near
the roadside.</p>

<p>Occasionally the travellers looked with curious interest,
as they contemplated, <i>en passant</i>, our mode of travelling.
It was a glorious warm sun, and we enjoyed our halt
amid the lovely scene.</p>

<p>The animals are reloaded, and we are odd at half-past
three o’clock. Shortly afterwards we were overtaken by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
a German smoking in his stolkjœrre. Very much
interested he seemed in our cavalcade, and evidently took
us for strolling players and musicians. He passed, and
then pulled up; stared, lingered, and ultimately offered
Esmeralda a seat in his stolkjœrre. She declined his
offer. Then he pressed it. We then came up, and told
him our party always preferred walking. He asked us
what we performed, and begged our pardon when he was
told we travelled for our pleasure, with our tent, and
baggage, to see the country.</p>

<p>The German said&mdash;“You are looking well; it agrees
with you. I prefer to travel faster. I do fourteen
Norsk miles a day (ninety-eight English). Wish you
all a pleasant journey.” And he drove off towards
Christiania.</p>

<p>The road was very pleasant. Sometimes through
forest, sometimes through the cultivated enclosure of a
gaard. A young Norwegian passed us at one place, who
spoke English. In passing through a forest, Noah picked
up a small spruce fir which was uprooted, and was lying
by the way. This replaced his broken alpenstock. It
was carefully peeled, and made into a respectable walking
staff.</p>

<p>At a short distance from Stee, we came in sight
of the river, and a fall of water, near some saw-mills,
apparently closed during the absence of the workmen at
the harvest. All were now busy in the fields. In
Norway the summer is short. To harvest quickly is a
matter of pressing necessity. Everything gives place to
the harvest. A tolerably quick man on a farm, we were
told, earned about twenty dollars a year wages&mdash;rather
more than four pounds English&mdash;his food lodging, two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
pairs of shoes and two pairs of stockings, and two shirts.
Men engaged by the day receive, we were told, about
one mark twelve skillings.</p>

<p>Near the mills, a stream of water crossed the road
from a thick wood on the left. The stream afterwards
joined the river near the mills. Through the wood, there
was a pathway leading to some open broken ground
surrounded by trees. It was a pleasant secluded spot,
not far from the road. Here we camped. Our aftens-mad
consisted of fried trout, tea, and barley-meal cakes
made in the frying pan. Zachariah caught seven trout,
and Noah three trout, in the river. We went after tea to
fish, but it was almost dark, and we returned to our camp.</p>

<p>In the early morning, at twenty minutes to four
o’clock, when we got up, the air was rather cold. Our
fire being lighted, we had for breakfast fried trout,
fladbröd, and tea. Zachariah went fishing, whilst Noah
was having his matutinal wash. Esmeralda, seated near
the fire, commenced. She was sorely grieved to think
we should part with the donkeys. The poor animals
would be left to be ill used in a strange country. She
did not like to part with things she was used to, after
they had gone with us so many miles. She looked as if
we were going to have them shot immediately after we
arrived at Christiania.</p>

<p>She pleaded so earnestly on their behalf, that she
would have won the heart of any one of the members
of the Humane Society, if he had been present.</p>

<p>What could we do? One, of course, was promised to
our friend the chevalier; but the other two? These
were not promised. We, of course, took what our
hobbenengree had said into consideration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span></p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, when the sun was up. In
the first burst of its splendour, we watched its broken
rays, gild the waters of the shaded stream, near our camp.
How rich in colouring, the tinted moss on the broken
rocks. We could have lingered long in contemplation.
Yet our party must quickly move. Our tents are struck,
and we are again <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Zachariah tried with his rod and line, as we went along
the road, but without success, and at last he put up his
tackle.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we arrived at the Stee Station. The
house was not far from the road on our left. Taking
Noah with us, we went up to purchase for our commissariat.</p>

<p>The guest-chamber is tolerably large, and well lighted,
but not very lofty. All the furniture was in the old
Norwegian style. On the walls we noticed likenesses of
Prindsesse Alexandra og Prindsen af Wales; also
Eugenie Keiserinde and Napoleon 3rd Keiser af
Frankrig.</p>

<p>Two travellers appeared below with carrioles. The
very civil and obliging mistress, we supposed her to be,
of the Stee Station, soon provided us with a beautifully
cooked pink trout from the Slidre Fjord, fladbröd, eggs
and potatoes and butter, for which we paid&mdash;</p>

<p>Then our young Norwegian hostess came down to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
road, with one or two piges of the house, to see our
donkeys, and have a chat with us, each knowing very
little of what the other said. Yet it is astonishing how
we managed to make ourselves understood, with our small
vocabulary of Norwegian words. They wanted us to
play, but Zachariah’s violin was out of order, and time
pressed. Bidding them all farewell, we were once more
<i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The Stee Station is pleasantly situated, not far from
the Slidre Fjord. Bears and game are said to be in
plenty in the neighbourhood; and we are able to say
that the trout are excellent. Those caught by Mephistopheles
in the river, a short distance before we came to
Stee, at our last camp, were delicious. Very shortly
after we had left Stee, the melancholy discovery was
made, that our donkey’s tether-rope, and neck-strap, had
been left behind at the last camp.</p>

<p>General recrimination among our gipsies. Esmeralda
had unloosed the Puru Rawnee the first thing in the
morning, to give it more liberty, and the rope was left on
the ground. Noah thought it was put up. Well, after
all, it may be of some use to those who found it. They
had no chance of restoring it, and we managed without,
during the rest of our travels.</p>

<p>Now we were again in enclosures. The road lay along
the left shore, and a short distance along the length of
“Slidre Fjord.” It is a long, and considerable extent of
water.</p>

<p>Our party had not gone very far, when we passed an
excellent house on the right of the road&mdash;much better
than those generally seen. Soon after, when we had
partly passed down the short descent beyond the house,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
a gentleman came after us. As he came up and addressed
us, we at once called a halt.</p>

<p>Two ladies then joined him. The gentleman was a
pale, and exceedingly intellectual-looking man. We
understood him to say that he had seen some account of
us in the <i>Times</i>. Afterwards, we heard him addressed
as Doctor.</p>

<p>Directly after, some more ladies came down the hill
from the opposite direction, accompanied by one or two
young gentlemen. One, a tall, gentlemanly, amiable,
young Norwegian, is especially selected to converse with
us in English, and act as interpreter.</p>

<p>In very good English he said, “I pray you, sir, speak
slowly, and I can understand you.” We did so, and
managed exceedingly well.</p>

<p>Our visitors had now increased to quite a large party
of ladies and gentlemen, all surrounding our gipsies and
donkeys, talking, discussing, asking questions, all in one
breath. It was quite a roadside scene, as we almost
blocked up the narrow part of the way at the foot of two
short ascents. The sun was exceedingly hot, fiery, and
bright.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, a lady in a carriole, driven by her
skydskarl, came down the rather steep descent towards
us. She was of English <i>distinguée</i> type of beauty,
and did not appear either comfortable, or delighted with
her mode of travelling. There was a pallor on her
countenance; she seemed nervous and delicate.</p>

<p>Another carriole, coming immediately behind, was
driven by a nice, good-humoured, handsome fellow, we
judged to be her husband. His wife, who did not speak,
had, like many who journey through life, a care-worn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
impress written on every line of her thoughtful countenance.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gone past, when the English traveller
suddenly pulled up, and we had a few minutes’ converse.
We thought he seemed, half to envy our independent
mode of travelling, for at parting he said, “Just the
thing I should like,” and, smiling, wished us a pleasant
journey.</p>

<p>After our English travellers had left us, we found our
visitors still interested in our gipsies, animals, and baggage.
Noah soon unpacked our tin box, and we presented one of
our songs to the Doctor, one to the young gentleman who
spoke English, and one to a very pleasant, kind, amiable
lady of the party.</p>

<p>Whilst Noah was rearranging our baggage, the young
gentleman who spoke English said, “Come further, where
there is ombre.” Very shortly we came to another exceedingly
comfortable, good-sized house, standing in its
nice pleasant garden, with an approach from the road.
The “Slidre Fjord” was below it, and the situation was
delightful. There they pressed us to remain, and take
rest; we would find shade and convenience. Finding we
could not stay, one of the ladies ordered her servants to
bring out bottled Baiersk öl and glasses, and a large jug
of excellent draught beer, which at last we consented to
have. We halted ’neath the shade of a tree which overhung
the road. Our gipsies were very thirsty; we were
obliged to be very firm as to quantity. Our kind friends
pressed us much to stay with our tents, but our time was
limited.</p>

<p>Then our guitar, and Zachariah’s violin were tuned up:
the heat and knocking about had not improved their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
tone. We sang for our kind entertainers our gipsy song.
Afterwards, three of the young ladies (and they were very
good-looking), joined by one of the young gentlemen,
sang for us. Very nicely they sang; one held a small
book of Norwegian songs, to assist the memory. Noah
and Zachariah afterwards gave them some music, with
their violin and tambourine.</p>

<p>The lady had fruit brought out. In all our wanderings
they were amongst those whose acquaintance&mdash;alas!
too short&mdash;will always be remembered with pleasure.</p>

<p>Time passes rapidly. The gipsies’ instruments are put
up. The kind Norwegian lady gave Esmeralda a bouquet
of flowers from her garden. There was much in this
present, which drew us still closer, in our appreciation of
her friendly thought. The heroine of our book receives
a bouquet of flowers! It is not thrown down at her
feet, with the grandiose air of “There, take it!” It is
given her by one whose amiable spirit had our sympathy,
and for whom we felt at that moment we could have
risked much. She had given the bouquet to the heroine
of our wanderings&mdash;Esmeralda, the true, not the fictitious,
heroine of this book!</p>

<p>The young gentleman who spoke English expressed in
English terms their good wishes. They were thoroughly
good people, with all the refinement, and gentleness of
those best feelings, which should predominate in our
nature. As we went out of sight, in passing a turn of
the road, we saw them in the distance, waving their
handkerchiefs in parting adieux.</p>

<p>It was now midday; the sun was intensely hot. Our
animals, who could stand almost anything, seemed
oppressed with the heat. We had, we believe, just left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
“Lomen.” There were enclosures on both sides the road;
no convenient place to give us shade and rest. We must
push on. Each day, as we wandered on, we never knew
where we should dine or sleep.</p>

<p>The district we now passed through was well cultivated.
Many gaards on each side the road. The peasants
were busy with their harvest. Even their anxiety
to make provision for the winter of life did not prevent
them from running, at times, with excited and unwonted
energy, to the road fences to see us go by.</p>

<p>At one place, we observed a tall peasant running down
a steep declivity; in his hurry he had left one of his
shoes behind, one on and the other off. “Here comes
neck or nothing,” said Esmeralda, as he nearly took a
header down a steep rock.</p>

<p>Still we had to keep on. Small patches of hops, we
noticed at some of the gaards, perhaps a few perches;
never, we remember, more than a rood. Yet they seemed
to grow luxuriantly. Trailing in their rich foliage, and
blossoms, they are always an interesting feature in any
scene. Now and then, we noticed hemp. There was
a well-to-do appearance in this district.</p>

<p>We had gone some distance in the heat of the sun,
travel-worn, and dusty; at last we descended a steep
declivity, and on our left we perceived a rough piece of
open ground, covered with scattered trees and bushes,
sloping to a dingle. A cool, clear stream, rippled near
an old mill, and crossed the road. The road descended,
and again as rapidly ascended. All was secluded.

<p>What delicious shade. Our water was soon boiling
near the old mill. Our readers must not suppose the
mill was a large one; it was about four times as large
as a good-sized sentry-box. We may have even exaggerated
the size. Norwegian mills are not on the
ponderous scale of English ones.</p>

<p>The middags-mad consisted of our Stee trout cold.
It was a fine trout, either steamed or boiled. In the
heat of the day, the trout was pronounced by our
gourmand gipsies excellent; some vinegar was allowed
with it, besides tea, fladbröd, butter, and fried eggs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>The time had marked two o’clock when we arrived.
The pleasant slope of green turf where we sat commanded
the road. Whilst we were taking our midday
meal, two Englishmen, one having a fishing-basket slung
over his shoulder, passed in a stolkjœrre. Then we
saw two young Norwegian tourists, in their high
laced-up boots, one of whom carried a skin knapsack;
they were pushing on at a swinging pace. Noah and
Zachariah of course fell asleep. Esmeralda went to
the old mill, and fancied she heard a curious moaning
sound, something like groaning in it. We did not
investigate it; besides, the mill was fastened; neither
had we any permission from the owner to go into his mill&mdash;sit
up in a haunted mill a few feet square! If the
wheel should be turned by the ghost, where should
we be? Ground to flour, eaten by a Norwegian
for his middags-mad&mdash;made into fladbröd, and eaten
by some English tourist. If we are to see ghosts,
let it be in an old castle, family mansion, or the
ruins of an abbey; but a mill;&mdash;besides, where was
the owner?</p>

<p>As we sat on the green slope, we observed a wooded
promontory, stretching into the fjord, below the road, and
sent Noah to reconnoitre for camping ground. The
Tarno Rye, we found, had a sore back; our bruise-mixture
was applied. Noah reported unfavourably for
remaining. The donkeys were loaded, and we quickly
left the dingle, and the haunted mill. Somehow we had
lingered, and lounged, in the pleasant shade, till after
five o’clock. <i>En àvant</i> was the word; away went tall
Noah in advance, with the Puru Rawnee before him,
the rest following, bag and baggage, as hard as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
party could go, Noah with his coat off and his trowsers
tucked up.</p>

<p>In the distance we could see Ulnœs church, near the
“Strand Fjord.” Now we met a party of English
tourists, bent upon enjoying themselves. Donkeys are
drawn up in line for them to pass as we push on, with
Noah in front. One said “Hvor meget,” pointing to
Noah’s stick; probably he took us for Norwegian gipsies.
Noah made no demur. The fir staff was in the Englishman’s
hands in two seconds, whilst the gipsy pocketed
two coins, which, we believe, made him one mark two
skillings richer. Our passing was so hasty, that nothing
more was said, as the jovial party, with much glee,
carried with them Noah’s staff, as a souvenir of the
incidents of travel.</p>

<p>Noah was well chaffed by Zachariah and Esmeralda.
Noah was in high glee; he had sold the stick he had
picked up yesterday, for one mark two skillings.
Mephistopheles was miserable with vexation, that he
had not a fir stick, to sell at one mark two skillings, to
some English tourist. A division was even suggested.
As the shorengro of the party, we should have come
in for the lion’s share. Nay, there is a precedent in
Isaac Walton, where the gipsies divide a sovereign.
Esmeralda supported the idea, but the suggestion was
without result.</p>

<p>Very shortly after we had passed Ulnœs church, we saw
a peasant standing on the roadside. His gaard was not
far from the road. At first, when we asked him, he said
he had no fladbröd, but afterwards said “Ya.” Esmeralda
and ourself went down to his house. First, he
brought down two very large rounds of fladbröd. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
we gave him a mark, he gave us half a mark back, and
brought four more large rounds down. One large round
of fladbröd generally costs two skillings.</p>

<p>It is difficult to purchase, even fladbröd, in harvest
time: most of the peasants are away from their houses.
If we had not been provided with a good commissariat,
and had trusted to what provisions we could purchase,
our party would have, indeed, fared very badly during
their wanderings.</p>

<p>It was now getting dusk. We were near the shores
of the Strand Fjord; nothing but inclosures met our
view on either side the road; we must soon camp somewhere.
It was nearly nine o’clock, when we came
to a steep, barren, stony bank above the road. The
upper portion was scantily wooded with birch trees
and bushes. Hobson’s choice. The donkeys were unloaded,
a fire lighted, and our baggage put on the only
available ground, behind a low rock, just above the road.</p>

<p>Our aftens-mad was not lively. Midges and musketos
attacked us on every side. Esmeralda got the water for
tea from the fjord; she had to go from the road, across
some enclosure, belonging to a cottage near. The woman
shortly after came up to the road fence. Mephistopheles
was interrogated in Norsk. Mephistopheles did not
understand a word the woman said. Mephistopheles
was extremely civil, saying “Ya, ya,” to every question
she asked. At length she wound up with “Hvor
fra” (where from?). To which Mephistopheles answered,
“Coryadreadaminch.” The woman immediately
left.</p>

<p>Very soon after we had halted, the loss was announced
of the brass fishing-reel, from the fishing-rod, Zachariah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
had been using. Zachariah had forgotten to take it off
the rod in the morning.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our tent was pitched on the only
available spot, consisting of loose angular stones, in
spite of midges and musketos, we were soon sound
asleep. The English gipsies in Norway, were long past
that deplorable state of modern effeminacy, when you
are unable to sleep comfortably on a gorse bush, with a
bundle of thorns for a pillow.</p>

<p>It had thundered, and lightened, and rained heavily in
the night. We were all fearfully bitten with musketos.
Noah had been unable to sleep; Esmeralda not much
better. Mephistopheles slept the best.</p>

<p>Being Saturday, the 13th August, we were anxious to
secure a good camping-ground for our Sunday’s rest, and
another day of quiet and repose. At three o’clock in the
morning our gipsies struck the tents. The frokost consisted
of tea, bacon, potatoes, cheese, and fladbröd.
Esmeralda was rather bilious, with a sore lip. Our anxiety
was great for the health of our Hobbenengree. Supposing
anything happened to Esmeralda, the heroine of this
book would be lost; and what is a book without a
heroine? The Birmingham bagman would at once
decline the work, as not according to contract. It
would have been utterly impossible to supply her loss.
There is no second Esmeralda&mdash;none like her. In
truth, with all her tempers, all her faults, Esmeralda was
the spirit of our wanderings. The pure Romnechal of
our expedition.</p>

<p>Our donkeys were nearly loaded, when we were surprised
by the apparition of a tall seaman, standing in
the road close by. He informed us he had stayed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
night at the house near&mdash;the same, probably, where
our friend, the woman of the previous evening, lived.
His ship had been lost near Throndhjem, and he was now
going to Bergen. Had been in America; spoke English
very well, with a strong American accent. We gave
him a dram of brandy, and two skillings; whereupon he
said, “It’s d&mdash;d bad for you not speaking Norsk,” and
wishing us a good voyage, departed.</p>

<p>Before six o’clock we were <i>en route</i>. The rain had
laid the dust; the morning was cloudy. There were
two fishermen’s boats on the Strand Fjord. We passed
the Strand Kirke. The scenery was very picturesque,
rocks towering above us on our left, the Strand Fjord
on our right. Some goats were racing and jumping on
the narrow crags of a steep precipice above us.</p>

<p>Coming to some saw-mills, we crossed a wild ravine.
Shortly after passing through a fir wood, we came in sight
of the Fagernœs station. A shop is said to be attached
to it. Upon inquiry, we found they had no shop, and
we could not purchase anything. Some people came
out to look at our donkeys, and we were soon <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The district through which we now passed seemed
more populated, and is called North Aurdal. Two
English tourists overtook us; one had a fishing-basket,
and said he had not had much sport. He shortly
after changed horses with a post-man, opposite a large
building to our right. At first we took it for a gentleman’s
mansion. It was the second building of stone, we
had seen, since we left Lillehammer. All was neatness,
with a drive to it from the road. When the English
tourist changed horses in the road, opposite the entrance,
we thought it might be a very first-class station. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
we came up, and had some conversation with a very
pleasant, well-dressed Norwegian, who was standing at
the entrance, we found it was the gaol of the North
Aurdal. He spoke English well, and had been in
America. It is very probable he was the governor.
They have a nice church at Aurdal, and a pleasant graveyard,
close to the road. The wooden crosses were in the
usual style. There was one simple marble monument,
bearing an inscription; we notice it, for its brevity&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Christopher Rogge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tódt 21 April, 1863,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dod Nov., 1865.<br /></span>
</span></span></p>

<p>As we came towards the Frydenland station, there
were many houses along the roadside; some, apparently,
for private residence. Two well-dressed young ladies
passed us, and one smiled so pleasantly, that we could not
omit the politeness of lifting our hat.</p>

<p>The Frydenland station is close to the road, and
seemed very comfortable. They have a good-sized
sitting-room, with a sofa, and all is exceedingly clean.
The mistress was very civil and attentive. Whilst she provided
us with three loaves of excellent bread, and a pound
of good butter, we discussed a bottle of baiersk öl in the
sitting-room. Noah and Zachariah came in for their
share. Esmeralda took charge of our baggage outside.
Our bread, butter, and bottle of öl cost two marks twelve
skillings. As we came out into the road, the donkeys
had found their admirers. A tall old gentleman with an
immense hat, a stout lady, and a young lady, from a
neighbouring house, and several people, were inspecting
our animals and baggage. As we left, we exchanged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
good-humoured salutations, and their looks implied their
best wishes for our <i>bon voyage</i>.</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock we approached to very nearly
the turn from the main road towards “Krœmmermoen.”
Coming to a large wooden trough on the roadside,
supplied with clear water by a wooden spout from the
rocks above, we called a halt. On the opposite side the
road, a convenient space had been left, with a long
wooden bench for travellers to sit upon. This is an
excellent provision for the convenience of the wayfarer,
which might be copied with advantage in England.
Below the stone wall, along the roadside, the ground
sloped to a valley.</p>

<p>Our baggage was all heaped behind the bench against
the wall. A fire was lighted in the rocks above the road,
and our water soon boiled for tea. A peasant, who lived
at a house near, soon came down the road. He was a
strong, powerful, intelligent-looking man, dressed in
leather knee-breeches, woollen stockings, large shoes, one
brace, and a spotted woollen shirt. The man was soon
joined, by two comely, young, good-humoured females,
probably his daughters. Then a peasant woman came
from another house; soon after, a tall man came from
we don’t know where. Peen giœre! Peen giœre! they
all exclaimed, as they gazed in bewildered admiration at
our donkeys. Out came the flask. We like to have our
things admired. Out came the tobacco, and the man in
leather breeches, borrowed a pipe from the tall man, and
began to smoke. We were evidently looked upon as
strolling actors of the better sort; yet the donkeys were
their chief delight. Then they were much interested in
our mode of making our tea in the Australian fashion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
putting the tea into the boiling water, and reversing the
usual mode. At length all, except one woman, and one
or two children, left us. After the sardines were gone
we presented the woman with the empty sardine box,
whereupon she seized us by the hand, and shook hands,
and immediately afterwards left, probably to place it in
the strong armoire of her salle à manger.</p>

<p>Then, as we were at our middags-mad, a carriage and
pair came in view, <i>en route</i> towards Bergen. Our
Tarno Rye stood in the road. Noah was detached, but
the Tarno Rye took himself off to the roadside, as soon
as he saw the carriage.</p>

<p>The skydskarl was driving. A young lady was seated
in front by the driver. An old gentleman and lady,
probably her parents, were behind. Never shall we
forget the young lady as the carriage came near our
Tarno Rye. With desperate eagerness she suddenly
snatched the whip from the boy. Then she dealt with
all her might one vigorous stroke at our Tarno Rye, who
was quietly standing on the roadside. We were amused
at the expression of determination, and serious earnestness
her countenance assumed. It is dreadful to think that
our gallant Tarno Rye, after all his wanderings, was so
nearly annihilated. What would Esmeralda have done?
Fortunately our Tarno Rye, like the little jackdaw, in
the Ingoldsby legend, was never a penny the worse.</p>

<p>Immediately after the carriage passed us, we saw what
we at once knew before, that she was English. A heavy
shower of rain came on soon afterwards, and, covering
our baggage with the waterproof, we all availed ourselves
of the same shelter. Our friend, the Norwegian farmer,
came down the road through the pouring rain, and asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
us to take shelter in his house. We explained that our
covering was waterproof. He said something about our
being wanderers, pointing good-naturedly towards his
house, and then left. He had come through the rain
himself, to offer us shelter and hospitality.</p>

<p>The rain cleared a little at half-past four o’clock, and
we left at five. The farmer came down again. We
gave him one of our gipsy songs as a souvenir, and he
seemed much pleased. Afterwards, he came and showed
us the turn from the Bergen and “Gjövig” road to
Krœmmermoen. Shaking hands, he left us, with many
wishes for our prosperous journey.</p>

<p>The road towards Krœmmermoen was similar to
one of our English country lanes, very pleasant, and
picturesque. At times we passed through thick fir
woods open to the road. It soon rained heavily. Noah
and Zachariah had no overcoats or change, and were
obliged to take their wetting philosophically. At some
places we tried for fladbröd, but in vain. One woman
came across a field, with wild fruit to sell us. We did
not take the fruit; but as she stood in the wet, we could
not help giving her some recompense. Ultimately, we
came to the edge of a tremendous declivity. If you
make a zigzag road down the outside of St. Paul’s, you
have got it. A very small piece of broken ground lay
on our right, at the edge of the steep precipitous descent.
On this we drove the donkeys. Just then, up drove a
carriole, and we recognised one of the young gentlemen
from Lomen. The carriole was one of the best we had
seen, and was drawn by a beautiful Norwegian pony.
Directly the pony caught sight of our donkeys, out got
our friend, with the inevitable p-r-r-rh p-r-r-r-rh. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
pony, with Noah’s assistance, was safely led past. Then
our Norwegian friend came to us, and we conversed, as well
as our knowledge of each other’s language would allow.
When he was gone, Noah and Zachariah were dispatched
to seek a camp-ground, lower down the hill, nearer to
Krœmmermoen. We were now above the deep and
charming valley of Lille Bang. The rain drizzled down
occasionally, as we stood on the broken ground, at the
edge of a deep, wooded steep. One donkey lay down
with its load. Esmeralda in her long cloak, paced the
wet turf, hot, and fiery. Our beautiful Puru Rawnee
had given her some offence. It seldom rains but it
pours. The Tarno Rye had escaped a young English
lady, and now our Puru Rawnee, was to be knocked
down by the heroine of our book. Very likely! Supposing
our Puru Rawnee killed! what then? The
Birmingham bagman will refuse his two copies. “You’ve
fallen short. Don’t find the Puru Rawnee at the end;
contract not complete.” Esmeralda makes a dash at our
beautiful donkey; her dark eyes flash fire. The spirit
of the young English lady pales before her. If the
young English lady had been there, it is probable she
would have learned a lesson in humanity. We interposed.
Fancy a studious, thoughtful, wanderer of nature,
staying, for the moment, the torrent of impetuous feeling
of the tall handsome gipsy-girl, Esmeralda, about to
overwhelm the beautiful Puru Rawnee, at the edge of
a wooded steep, in the mizzling rain, of a Norwegian
summer’s eve! Gipsies are creatures of impulse. Few
words said we. Strong, and impetuous as were the
passions of our heroine, she had a heart&mdash;at times, could
deeply feel. The Puru Rawnee escaped unhurt.

SCENE.</p>

<p>In a short time, Esmeralda and ourself slowly
descended the steep winding road towards Krœmmermoen,
as we heard the gipsy’s whistle in the distance.
Evening was fast closing. The road wound zigzag
round the head of a deep gorge. Soon afterwards, to our
left above the road, we saw Noah, with a fire blazing in
the rocks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

<p>It was a retired nook of the road, which had been
almost made on purpose. The last of our Cheddar cheese
was brought out for our evening meal. The cheese had
kept good through all our wanderings. We had also tea,
broiled ham, and what remained of our fladbröd. A few
people passing down the road, came up to our tents.
Night closed in, and the wanderers, after their long day’s
journey, were soon soundly asleep.</p>

<p>Heavy rain fell in the night. We were up in good
time next morning. For frokost, we had biscuits, and
butter and tea. The morning was showery; but many
visitors came to see us. Then the Lehnsmœnd, a brother,
we think, of the Prœst of Bang, came to our tents. The
herre had a young lady, we believe a niece, with him. He
was a pleasant, gentlemanly man, who spoke English
very well. After we had shown him our tents, he said,
if we stayed the next day, he should be happy to
introduce us to his brother. As he left our camp, we
presented him with our gipsy song, as a souvenir.</p>

<p>A tin of preserved Australian meat was opened. Really
this meat is excellent. What could be better? Even
our gipsies were perfectly satisfied, and thoroughly
enjoyed it. With some boiled potatoes, we made an
excellent middags-mad.</p>

<p>At five o’clock we sent Noah and Zachariah down to
Krœmmermoen to buy bread. They met with our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
friend from Eisbod, on the Bygdin Lake. He had been
taken ill, and could not proceed on his journey.</p>

<p>Whilst they were away, some young ladies came to
our camp, and sat on the rocks near. At last one bowed
to Esmeralda, who spoke to her, and asked her to take a
seat in our tent; but she hesitated. We went to them.
They seemed much interested in our tent life. The
young lady, who spoke English, said she was merely a
visitor at Bang. She expatiated on the beauties of the
valley, and then she asked us, if we would kindly give
her one of our songs. She said she had written some
verses herself, and begged our acceptance of them. The
young Norwegian lady had very pleasing manners&mdash;something
winning and charming. Perhaps she had not
the highest type of beauty; still there was a power to
fascinate, such as we had not often met with, even in
those of a more perfect mould&mdash;a softness, a gentleness of
manner, always accompanied with goodness of disposition,
and kindness of heart. Poetry! Yes; it vibrated in
every word she spoke. Could we refuse her anything?
Two copies of our songs were brought forth from the
recesses of our tin box. We presented one, to our fair
visitor, and the other, to one of her friends. There was a
third; but unfortunately we had forgotten there were
three lady-visitors. The verses presented to us we shall
prize. Reader, we must give them place in this account
of our wanderings. Our book would be incomplete without
them.</p>

<p>The following are the Norwegian verses. The translation
we have had made, is also given with them. Our
readers will not now be surprised that we admired the
beautiful scenery of Lille Bang.

<p>Noah and Zachariah returned with the kagebröd, dark,
heavy bread, with carraway seeds in it.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Our friend
from Eisbod had sent to say, he would come up to our
camp, if well enough. They had also made acquaintance,
with an old Norwegian, who resided near the village.
He showed them his violin, for which he wanted four
dollars.</p>

<p>After we had finished our tea, bread, and butter, more
visitors arrived. One peasant was an important representative
of royalty. He wore a large waistcoat; on
every button he had a photograph of some potentate.
The King and Queen of Sweden, the Prince and Princess
of Wales, and the King of Sardinia, were among the
number. His waistcoat, in fact, included nearly all the
crowned heads of Europe. After tea, we sat in the rocks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
above our camp. The evening was very damp, and
showery. When we returned, our visitors were still
sitting by our tents. Notwithstanding heavy rain, they
continued until about nine o’clock.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the morning when we were
stirring. The Tarno Rye’s back was much chafed. The
donkeys had eaten the best part of one of our pocket
handkerchiefs, the day before. For frokost we had tea,
black-bread, and cheese.</p>

<p>The morning was cloudy, as we left our camp at half-past
six o’clock. We did not feel so well as usual. Our
health had been excellent throughout. As we passed a
cottage, the gipsies pointed out the old man’s house, with
its flag, and large stone, with a photograph let into it, of
his majesty Carl John.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>When we came to the Krœmmermoen station soon
afterwards, Noah and Zachariah were sent to buy bread,
and wire at the shop. The station is apparently
exceedingly comfortable. Esmeralda went on with the
baggage. Going up stairs, we were shown into our
friend’s bed-room. Our friend from Eisbod was in bed
looking very pale and unwell. Something had disagreed
with him, and he had not been well since he left Skogstad.
Apparently he had a severe attack of diarrhœa. Our
bread cost us one mark, potatoes four skillings, and wire
ten skillings.</p>

<p>As we left our friend, he said he should try and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
continue his journey the same morning. It seemed as if
we were ever destined to pass, and repass, and meet
continually.</p>

<p>When we overtook our baggage shortly after, near the
village church of Bang, we found our lady visitors of the
previous day, and the Lehnsmœnd, and their friends,
assembled, to give us their parting good wishes. Much
we regretted, that our time did not permit us to stay
another day. Bang is delightfully situated. However
powerful the description, there is much that the poet’s
pen, will fail to convey.</p>

<p>The Lehnsmœnd, our agreeable visitor of the previous
day, the young gentleman we had seen at Lomen on the
Slidre Fjord, the ladies, especially our fair visitor, who
had given us the verses, were as charming as before. All
united to say to us “<i>Bon voyage</i>,” as we left the lovely
dale of Lille Bang.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>After we had left Bang, the road reached the river’s
bank. Fortunately there was a horse-boat, with a landing
and all complete. The ferry-house was on the other
side; the river Beina was before us. The old man at
the ferry wore breeches and stockings, and very large
shoes. He was heavy, stooping, and slow, and was
followed by his son, who was his duplicate, in large
baggy trousers, and immense shoes, and a shade slower
still. They were a perfect study. A draper’s assistant
would have measured up their time, at five minutes the
yard. Both had a sparkle of comicality in their eyes, as
they helped our gipsies to carry our baggage from the
donkeys into the boat. Strange to say, the donkeys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
walked on to the horse-boat, without a moment’s hesitation.
The old man rowed with two very large oars,
whilst his son slowly used a shaft.</p>

<p>The boat reached the opposite bank, and the donkeys
were safely landed. Two females, we took for his wife
and daughter, came to a fence to look at our donkeys.
The old man began to assist in taking our baggage on
shore. Presently Mephistopheles rushed on deck. The
old man was slowly dragging at a heavy pocket, which
generally took the strength of Noah, and ourself, to lift
on to the Puru Rawnee. Suddenly Mephistopheles,
spinning the old man almost round, like a tee-to-tum,
swung it over his shoulder like a feather, and in two
seconds deposited it on shore. We shall never forget the
old man’s look of amazement, and his son’s sudden pause
to take another look at Mephistopheles. Then Mephistopheles
in his hurry tumbled headlong over some bags,
to the amusement of the two ferrymen.</p>

<p>It was found that a rope had been left on the other
side the river. Mephistopheles jumped into a light
pram, and by his rapidity, almost tumbled the man’s son
into the bottom of the boat. Away went Mephistopheles,
with two oars, splashing across the river. Now they are
coming back, the old man’s son sprawling in the stern, as
he holds on, with astonished look; whilst Mephistopheles,
with fearful irregularity, is sending the waters of the
Beina in all directions.</p>

<p>Our gipsies are screaming with laughter. “Ha, ha!
Uncle Sam coming from Bosbury, a seaport town in
England! Dik the Balo-Shero. Look at Elijah! Why,
he’s got a square nose.”</p>

<p>We were exceedingly thankful that our gipsies’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
tatersprog and English slang was never understood.
“Coming from Bosbury,” had reference to a question, a
countryman once asked one of the tribe, “Where’s
Bosbury?” “Bosbury? why, it’s a seaport town in the
middle of England, with lots of ships!” “Well,” said
the rustic, “I never heerd on it afore.”</p>

<p>Whilst the ferryman’s son was enjoying his rapid
transit, his father, mother, and sister, as we supposed
them to be, were enjoying our brandy. Of course, the
son, when he did land, drank “gamle norge” to his
happy escape. It was not the first aquavit he had taken.
Energy is catching; they began to look quite sharp.
Our transit cost twelve skillings. Mephistopheles played
them a tune on his Violin. The ferryman and family
seemed highly delighted. We left with their good wishes,
to continue our journey.</p>

<p>Still we became more and more unwell. Slowly we
went on, until we came to a large gaard, of superior size,
and comfort.</p>

<p>The road passed through a large open meadow, shut
in by gates, on the banks of the river. Near the river
the grass had been newly mown. The farmer, and some
of his family, came to see the donkeys, which the gipsies
halted for their inspection. The farmer’s wife asked if
they stood on their hind legs. The people seemed so
kindly; the meadow so charmingly situate, on the banks
of the broad river, that we decided to stay. We made
the farmer, and his wife, understand that we wanted a
mark of fladbröd, and six skillings’ worth of milk.
Esmeralda went to the gaard for it. They nearly filled
one large can full of milk. Noah in the meantime lighted
a fire, and made the gröd. The donkeys were driven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
across a dry portion of the shingly bed of the river, to a
green island for rest and shade.</p>

<p>The farmer and his wife sat down near us. It was
astonishing the kindly interest they took. We fancy we
looked ill and worn. At first we said nothing to our
gipsies. It may probably pass away, thought we. “Du
courage.” Esmeralda soon discovered that something was
the matter with the Rye, and we told her. Still we sat
on the beautiful new mown turf, gazing on the rapid
broad flowing river, the farmer, and his wife and family
near. Then the donkeys were driven back for us to
go. Some of the family brought green corn, and green
peas, for the donkeys to eat. Then we gave the farmer’s
wife a song, for, somehow, we seemed to have established a
friendship with them. The farmer’s wife seemed anxious
to know our name; so we wrote it on the back of
the song, with the date. Then she asked, whose wife
Esmeralda was, and if we worked in metals. They did
not quite seem to understand, when we said we travelled
for pleasure. So we parted from the friendly farmer,
and his wife, and family, at about twelve o’clock, and
continued our journey.</p>

<p>Passing the Höler Elv, we came towards Storsveen.
Once a man came out of a wood, hastily put up his
scythe, and followed us. He wanted to see our donkeys.
The grain is stacked up in the fields, sheaf upon sheaf,
round poles, six feet high. Zachariah tried the river, but
could not catch any fish. It did not appear there were
many.</p>

<p>Near Storsveen, we saw a pig with a broken nose.
Soon after we had passed the turn down to the Storsveen
Station, we noticed behind us a traveller. It was our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
friend from Eisbod, walking after us with his knapsack.
We had met again. Our friend said he was much better,
and was going to Storsveen; but seeing us before him,
he had overtaken us. After a pleasant converse, he
returned to Storsveen Station to get a conveyance, and
said he should overtake us again.</p>

<p>Struggle as we would, we got worse. Our gipsies
noticed it. They became more silent. We told Noah
to camp, at the first convenient spot. About two
o’clock we came to a beautiful part of the valley.
All that we could desire. The road passed through an
amphitheatre of green turf, closed in by rising rocks,
covered with dense, and thickly hanging woods. In
front we had the broad river. A dry, level, shingly
beach, stretched out, to nearly the middle of the stream.
On the opposite bank, to our right, there was a magnificent
cliff, above the river, clothed with wood. The
scene was well suited for a rest. Our gipsies quickly
drove the donkeys to a rising hillock, beneath the wood,
a short distance from the road, and pitched our tents.
Our friend from Eisbod, came soon after in a conveyance.
Paying a short visit to our camp, he had
one of our cigars, a pleasant converse, and had almost
recovered.</p>

<p>As he was leaving in his conveyance, two smart
young tourists came along the road; they were on foot.
Their whole equipment was neatness, even to the
umbrella. As, very far from well, we sat near our
tent, we could see them in conference, with our friend
from Eisbod. Immediately afterwards, one produced
a sketch-book, and apparently sketched the donkeys.
Then he appeared to be taking a sketch of our camp,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
and Esmeralda, and ourself. Noah got up, and in an
earnest tone said, “They are ‘lelling’ you, sir,” and
vanished off to the river, where Zachariah was disporting
himself on the shingly beach, with nothing on but his
shirt.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> They at last appeared to have completed the
sketch of our donkeys, and camp, for suddenly the book
was shut. They took off their hats; we, of course
returned the salute, and they continued their excursion.
If we had not been so unwell, we should have sought
their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Very quietly we rested in our camp. Esmeralda did
what she could. No one came. It was just such a
spot one could wish to die in. Yes; but who is to
write “Tent Life with the English Gipsies in Norway”?
Where are the Birmingham bagman’s two copies?
Where will be the many others required, including that
for the officer with the Roman fever? Are they to
be disappointed? No: we shall not fail them, in the
closing scenes of our nomad wanderings.</p>

<p>Noah came back before our aftensmad, with thirteen
minnows, and Zachariah three, which were fried for tea,
with fladbröd and butter. The afternoon was beautiful,
and at nine o’clock we retired to rest.</p>

<p>It is Tuesday, 16th August. <i>En route</i> Zachariah,
“Vand” “Yog.” We are all up at half-past three
o’clock. It rained a little, and was very cloudy. One
carriole passed on the road in the night, and another
early in the morning. Noah lighted a fire, and we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Australian preserved meat, and fladbröd, and tea for
breakfast.</p>

<p>When the gipsies were packing up, a man and a boy
came across the river in a boat, to look at the donkeys.
Whilst they were absent from their boat, Esmeralda
went to the river to wash, and getting into the boat
to amuse herself, it got detached from the side, and she
was floating away, without oars, into the middle of the
river, when she jumped out nearly up to her middle.
This incident, she did not relate until afterwards,
thinking we might be angry with her, for getting into
the boat.</p>

<p>The tents are struck, the donkeys loaded, and we
are off at eight o’clock. The rest and repose at our
beautiful camping ground, had given us renewed spirit.
We were decidedly better. The weather cleared. The
road winds, through a diversified scene, of thick fir
woods, and occasional enclosures. One very large gaard
on the opposite side the river, before we reached Sorum,
was admirably arranged for comfort and convenience.
It was pleasantly placed above the river. We noticed a
pigeon-box against a large granary, the only one we saw
in Norway.</p>

<p>Coming to a delightful spot, near a stream of water, in
a wood, not far from the road, we halted. There were
some houses on the other side the road. One woman
was singing, who had an excellent voice. We seldom
heard any singing in Norway. Singing birds, and singing
women, were scarce. We were pleased with this woman’s
voice.</p>

<p>Our middag’s-mad consisted of Australian meat, fladbröd
and butter, and cheese and tea. We had also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
chocolate. An altercation took place between Noah and
Zachariah. Mephistopheles shouted so loud, we gave him
a bang on the head, which effectually laid his spirit
low.</p>

<p>At half-past three o’clock, the party were again <i>en
route</i>. The country was very pleasing; the weather
delightful. Zachariah played, from time to time, his violin,
as we slowly journeyed along. The Sorum Station is a
quaint old place. The road passes through a sort of
court surrounded by wooden buildings. It is kept by
very respectable people. We purchased twenty-two
skillings’ worth of fladbröd and butter. All the <i>gens de
la maison</i> assembled to see us, including the traveller,
who had passed in his carriole.</p>

<p>With mutual salutations, we again left, Zachariah playing
his violin, as we passed through a thick forest. Then
we had more enclosures, and some pretty rural lanes.
At last, towards the close of evening, when the road
passed through an open fir wood, we noticed a large
lagoon, or open arm of the river, to our left, on the
margin of the wood.</p>

<p>A halt was called, and we camped on the edge of the
wood, below the road. Our tents were pitched near two
tall Scotch firs, standing outside the wood, with a pleasant
view across the lagoon. It was from six to seven
o’clock, when we halted. Noah and Zachariah went fishing,
but without success. Our aftens-mad consisted of
tea, ham, fladbröd, butter, and chocolate. Esmeralda
and ourself practised Romany. Our health was fast
returning&mdash;in fact, we were almost as well as usual.</p>

<p>Up at four o’clock. Now, Noah! Zachariah! Noah got
the water, and our fire was lighted. We were just going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
to breakfast at five o’clock, when three men, and a peasant
woman came by. They were going harvesting.
Loud were their exclamations of “peen giære” (fine
beauty), “meget peen,” “nei, nei.” They looked curiously
at our preparations for breakfast, and then left.</p>

<p>When Noah was loading our donkeys, three men and
a girl came to see the donkeys, and were surprised at
the weight they carried. It appeared we were at a
place pronounced like Helgst, about one furlong from
Nœs.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock, pushing onwards along a pleasant
forest road, we again came to enclosures. Then a church
appeared to view and a rifle range. The range appeared
a very short one, having a booth, apparently used as a
shelter for the marksmen.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> We had now left the
Valders, and had seen some of the beauties of the
Aadalen. Nœs was at the upper shore of the Spirilen
Lake, and it would be necessary to cross the Beina at its
outfall to the lake.</p>

<p>The Nœs Station is large, and in a wooden building
near, we found a shop containing a variety of goods of all
sorts, and sizes. First we bought wooden spoons, and soap,
for twenty-two skillings, and then some fladbröd for
one mark. Noah had gone beyond the house, to the
ferry-boat, on the lake shore. Esmeralda and ourself
were leaving the shop, when we met Noah, with a gloomy
countenance. He informed us there was no horse-boat,
and the donkeys could not possibly cross.</p>

<p>Saying we should soon see whether we could cross, we
all went down with a civil man, who seemed the owner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
of the ferry, and premises. After much talking, he explained
that the steamer left at seven o’clock in the
morning, and it was now nine o’clock, and we were too
late.</p>

<p>Looking at the two small boats, we explained to the
ferryman, that we must get across somehow. He seemed
to catch our meaning; but our gipsies shook their heads,
and said the poor donkeys would be drowned.</p>

<p>To continue our journey, we were determined. The
obstacle of a river was not to be thought of, for a moment.
A day would be lost, by camping at Nœs until the next
morning. Although we might probably make up lost
time in the steamer, still we preferred going on by land,
if possible.</p>

<p>Returning to the shop, we bought a pound of white
sugar for 20 skillings. The old man in the meantime
appeared with two men, and poles, and a strong tether
rope, and an axe. Again we returned to the sandy beach.
Noah and Zachariah were very desponding at the sight.
It looked very much as if they were going to erect a
scaffold, and behead the donkeys on the spot. The
owner of the ferry shortened one of the poles, and in a
few minutes, the two small boats were securely lashed to
the two poles, extending over them crossways. Our
gipsies were still unable to disconnect the donkeys, with
anything short of drowning.</p>

<p>A small crowd of peasants now collected to view the
passage of the Beina by the English gipsies in Norway,
with their animals and baggage. Most of the men, who
chewed tobacco, were dressed in light jumpers, patched
trowsers, and large heavy boots, without stockings; the
kind-looking stout female, who sold us the fladbröd, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
there, and young peasant girls, with handkerchiefs tied
over their heads.</p>

<p>The Tarno Rye was first bridled, and led to the boats by
Zachariah. There it decidedly refused to go any further.
Zachariah pulled, Noah lifted at its hind legs, ourself and
two men lifted at the fore legs. The struggle ended, in
our fairly carrying the donkey into the one boat, at the
risk of all coming down into the water, together with one
tremendous splash; the other boat was turned sideways,
and we forced the Puro Rye into it, whilst a man held
its head. The boats were quickly rowed off by another
man, and the animals safely landed.</p>

<p>One man was bold enough to ride one of the donkeys
to a wood close to the sandy beach. Zachariah rowed
back. All were highly pleased at the success. The
Puru Rawnee made a tremendous fight. Zachariah tugged,
and the Puru Rawnee got one hind leg over the boat’s
side; but a stout fellow, who ultimately nearly pushed it
over Zachariah, placed its leg safe in the boat. The
baggage was put in the other boat, to balance the donkey,
and then they crossed the river.</p>

<p>The boats returned. We paid the man fifteen skillings,
which seemed to satisfy all, and with our gipsies, and the
rest of our baggage, soon reached the other side. Several
were collected, when we landed: one gentlemanly, well-dressed
Norwegian, looked at our maps, and pointed out
the route. Esmeralda immediately began to castigate
her donkey, then scolded Zachariah, and was in her turn
scolded by ourself, whilst the boatmen drank “gamle
norge” in our aquavit.

<p>Noah and Zachariah quickly loaded the donkeys;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> one
of the boatmen showed us the way. We followed a
track from the river through the wood. An old boat
near the river, in the wood, turned on one side, with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
marks of a fire having been lighted before it, showed
that it had been used as a bivouac.</p>

<p>Passing through the court of a large house, near the
wood, we shortly afterwards, entered by a gate into a
pleasant shady way, leading along the left shore of the
Spirilen Lake. A large crowd were still watching our
cavalcade from the house.</p>

<p>It was about twenty minutes past ten o’clock, when
we left the river Beina;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> a halt was called at eleven, in a
wood, on the shores of the Spirilen.</p>

<p>Our middags-mad consisted of soup, made of potatoes,
ham, bacon, and Liebig’s essence, with addition of some
gröd.</p>

<p>Zachariah went fishing, but was unsuccessful. The
rain commenced, and we either slept, or wrote our notes
from about two o’clock until four o’clock.</p>

<p>Again we were all on the move. Following the rough
track through the fir-forest, we had pleasing vistas of the
lake. Then we came to where some men were making
a new road, and sometimes, we had to change from the
old road, on to the new portion, lately opened for traffic;
passing Bjönvicken to Engordden the road had enclosures,
and farms on either side. About six o’clock we noticed
the steamer going up the lake to Nœs. At one place, we
passed a new house, which appeared to have a shop.
Soon after, a little girl followed us with something
wrapped in a white napkin. It occurred to us, to send
Noah back, and see if he could get bread. The little girl
at once guessed what we wanted, and told us bread could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
be purchased, at six skillings a loaf. She was a neatly
dressed, intelligent little girl, and we gave her 3 skillings
for her information; she at once seized our hand, and said
tak; soon afterwards she went into a house on the roadside.</p>

<p>There were nothing but inclosures for some distance.
The evening was rapidly closing; on we pushed: no camp
ground; still we hurried along. We were now on a
part of the road recently made, and must shortly sleep
somewhere. At last, just at dark, a small driftway was
noticed, to a narrow strip of new-mown turf, between the
road, and the lake. No time for hesitation; the donkeys
were quickly driven down to the turf. Some high
bushes formed a screen from the road, and a shelter for
ourselves. A boat was moored on the sandy beach near.
The donkeys were at once unloaded in a quiet corner, a
fire was lighted on the shore, and our water quickly
boiled.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Zachariah was on the look-out for Noah, who soon
came with three loaves of bread, which had cost a mark.
The tents were at once pitched. Our gipsies made short
work of tea, bread and cheese. “Let’s gell to our woodrus,”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
said Noah. “Cushty ratti,”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> said we; and they were
soon asleep. It was a dark murky night, as we sat by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
dying embers of our fire. Gradually the rain increased,
and we retired to our tent. The turf had been newly mown,
and was delicious to rest upon. We listened to the boat
rising and falling on the waves, as they dashed in the
night wind, on the sandy shore. It had rained heavily
during the night, accompanied by lightning. Between two
and three o’clock in the morning we were up, the morning
was dark and cloudy, with misty rain. Fire was lighted;
Noah warmed up some simmin (gip., soup),<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> saved from
yesterday’s middags-mad; we had also tea, and bread and
cheese&mdash;an odd combination&mdash;which was hastily disposed
of. The top of a house could be seen on the other side
the road, close above us: the inhabitants little thought
they had visitors sleeping just below them. It is
probable that they would be sorely puzzled, when they
went for the boat’s paddles, in the bushes behind our tent,
to see the impression on the turf&mdash;the impression left
by our sleeping forms. Perhaps they might think, some
Huldre or fairy had been there: at any rate, we did not
wait to elucidate the occurrence, which may be involved
in mystery to this day. At five o’clock, animals, baggage,
and gipsies were well on the road towards Finsand.</p>

<p>There was something exciting in our wanderings. Our
animals still continued quite equal to their work, and
every day decreased the weight of the commissariat; the
weight they had to carry was now much lighter. At
eight o’clock we halted on the margin of an open bay
of the Spirilen Lake, near some houses. As we were
having another meal of cold bacon, meat, and bread
and cheese, and tea, we saw the steamer pass down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
lake from Nœs. A woman and a man came and wanted
to buy one of the donkeys.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, we were again on the move towards
Somdalen. Then we came to a narrow channel of the
lake, through which the steamers pass to the Aadals Elv.
The road, after passing through Somdalen, continued
through fir-forests, and pleasant scenes. At one part of
the forest, we saw some wood pigeons, and at another, a
jackdaw. When we had passed Somdalen, we halted
again; our rest was on a greensward surrounded by a
stream, in an open space below the road, surrounded by
a wood. It was a nice secluded spot. We halted at a
quarter to twelve; the sun was warm and pleasant;
we had tea, fried ham, and bread. Esmeralda’s spirits
were in the ascendant. We left at twenty-five minutes
to two o’clock. Our way was through beautiful forests,
which reminded us of some of the wild scenes of Australia.
As to Mephistopheles, he was buzzing about
like a butterfly; we nearly crushed him once or twice.</p>

<p>At last we came to a large farm on the borders of the
forest, by Ytre Aadalen Val. The road led from the
forest, over a rise of open cultivated ground, near a
large and convenient gaard. We had lingered behind.
As we again came up with our gipsies, they were
passing over the cultivated land near the gaard.
The master of the Bondegaard, a stout man, and
apparently his wife and two daughters, and a large
retinue of dependants, were grouped to see us pass.
They surveyed us with curiosity, but did not speak.
Scarcely had our gipsies got out of hearing, than one
of the dependants was the subject of severe criticism.</p>

<p>“Look at that country gorgio,” said Mephistopheles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span></p>

<p>“Ha,ha!” said Esmeralda; “why, he’s a kok-y-yock”
(cock-eye).</p>

<p>“No,” said Noah; “that’s our varnon.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>“O nei! O nei!” said Mephistopheles; “peen giære,
peen giære!”</p>

<p>Somebody was extinguished, and order was restored.
Gipsies, as a rule, not being educated, and having a
great amount of gaiety, and physical energy, in default,
occasionally, of rational conversation, seize upon circumstances,
and things, of the most minor importance, to
occupy their attention, in a warfare of Romany chaff
against everyone, and everything, with singular expression,
tempered with strange energy, and lively spirit.</p>

<p>The master of the Bondegaard was exceedingly stout,
and we reasoned afterwards, upon the inconvenience of
being so stout, and the advantage of a gipsy life, in
keeping the body, in its proper symmetrical proportions.</p>

<p>Now we are in the forest again, and this portion of
our route, is much more beautiful than we expected.
The Spirilen does not rival many of the Norwegian
lakes, though there are many pleasant scenes along its
shores.</p>

<p>At this part of our route we saw some of the most
lofty spruce-fir we had seen during our wanderings in
Norway.</p>

<p>We were now fast coming towards Heen, where the
steamer meets, we were told, the railway to the Rands
Fjord.</p>

<p>Through the forest we went. Esmeralda, who was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
lively at our last halt, seemed getting tired, and wanted
to ride, but our camp rule did not allow it. Again, we
hoped soon to halt: the heroine of our book was not to
be neglected, and lost by the way, for the want of care
and proper attention.</p>

<p>Soon after we descended a steep declivity in the forest,
and came upon a charming glade on a stream, which,
we believe, is called the Vœls Elv. At the foot of the
declivity, flowed its shallow stream of water. On the left
of the forest-way, before we reached the stream, we saw
some open green turf, secluded by clumps of forest trees,
and beyond, and on all sides, a woodland of apparently
interminable forest, as far as the eye could reach. ’Twas
a lovely spot for the tired Esmeralda to repose.</p>

<p>The tents were put up at once in the open glade,
near the flowing stream. We were soon engaged writing
letters. Esmeralda was washing at a fire near a clump
of trees, not far from the stream. Noah was making a
basket. A tall blacksmith, as we supposed him to be,
carrying a rifle, came to our tents. He told us there
were wolves, and bears in the forest. Then we had
afterwards, a party of three gentlemen, and a lady;
they were very nice people. One dark, good-looking
young gentleman, spoke English. We were pleased to
see them at our tents. They inspected our camp,
Russian lamp, cooking apparatus, and our donkeys.
They seemed much pleased. It would have given us
pleasure to have known more of them.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a beautiful camping-ground, in a large
wild forest. Our fourth meal this day&mdash;for we had
crowded on considerable sail&mdash;consisted of tea, sardines,
bread and cheese. At nine o’clock, all were resting in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
our tents. It is noted in our impressions, that the
evenings get colder and shorter, chilly and damp.</p>

<p>Friday, the 19th of August; we are again stirring
at twenty minutes past three o’clock. Up rise our three
gipsies, in the wild Norwegian forest: <i>en avant</i> is the
word.</p>

<p>As we were standing by our camp-fire, we heard
footsteps; a man and a boy appeared at that early
hour, to see our donkeys. They were astonished to find
anyone already up and moving.</p>

<p>The frokost consisted of tea, biscuits, and cheese.
Our donkeys loaded, we moved off at six o’clock. Noah
left his unfinished basket on our camp-ground, as a
souvenir. Soon we passed under the arch of the Rands
Fjord Railway. Then the road lay through enclosures,
and we came in sight of Hönefos.</p>

<p>Before we entered the town of Hönefos, we cautioned
Mephistopheles, as to propriety of conduct. It was,
perhaps, about nine o’clock; many people came out of
their houses, and anxiously inquired what the donkeys
were. Mephistopheles called for a glass of sherry, and
imitated a drunken man, until he was called to attention.
A civil Norwegian coming up, we inquired for the
Postaabneri and a krambod.</p>

<p>Keeping Noah with us, we sent the donkeys and
baggage through the town, in care of Esmeralda and
Zachariah. Coming into a sort of square, our first visit
was the post-office; we went into a court-yard, and
entering the back of a house, we soon found ourselves
in a small room, with a kind of bank counter,
behind which sat a respectable-looking, pale, intelligent
man. By his side, he had an ear-trumpet, for he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
deaf; behind him, he had shelves, filled with books; on
his long table, he had writing materials, documents,
and papers relating to his duties. He spoke in English
with a very good accent; we wrote our answers, for he
was deaf. The postage of our English letter, was sixteen
skillings, and four skillings each for our letters
to Christiania. Readily giving us some information,
about the steamers with mails from Christiania, we left
our civil postmaster. The war seemed the all-engrossing
topic of the time, and we had, of course, some converse
on the subject.</p>

<p>Our next visit was to the shop, where we bought five
pounds of sugar, for three marks eight skillings; five
loaves of bread, for one mark six skillings; and, at a
baker’s, we bought two loaves of bread, for eight skillings
and six cakes for six skillings.</p>

<p>Hönefos is a spirited town, and a pretty one. Crossing
the Hönefos Bridge we soon rejoined our baggage. As
we ascended a hill, and continued our route along the
new road, which is being made, we had a beautiful view
of the town.</p>

<p>A French gentleman, who was driving towards the
Hönefos, had asked Esmeralda and Zachariah, if they
were French.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we came to an iron mile-stone, marked
five miles to Christiania og Dramen (thirty-five English
miles).</p>

<p>Then we saw Norderhoug church. It is large, as
compared with many of the Norwegian churches we
had seen. The parsonage and village have an air of
substantial comfort. Geese and ducks, and cherry-trees
were seen for the first time during our wanderings in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Norway. This village is noted for the destruction of
a small Swedish force, which was quartered at the
Parsonage House in 1716.</p>

<p>Still following onwards along our route, we came to
enclosed lands, which appeared quite as fertile as any
we had seen. Here and there, the harvest people would
hurry towards the road fence, to catch a sight of our
donkeys, as they passed. Some asked one question,
some another. Our gipsies answered wildly any Norwegian
word at hand, or ya! ya! Now we meet a
carriage and pair, and the gentleman takes off his hat,
which we of course acknowledge.</p>

<p>At length we halt on the right of the road on the
hill above “Vik Station,” on some rocky open ground.</p>

<p>It was twelve o’clock. Our gipsies obtained some
water for our tea at the Vik Station from their private
supply. A servant girl, and man, with some children
from the station, brought our donkeys some grass. It
was a kindly thought. The sun was warm as we sat
amid the rocks and heath. Whatever faults our gipsies
have they are not tainted with Fenianism or Communistic
ideas. They have ever held for Monarchy,
and even among themselves, they have from time to
time, their kings and queens. Our gipsies are extremely
ignorant of political philosophy. They do know that
her Majesty Queen Victoria, is the Queen of England.
The names of Disraeli and Gladstone had not yet reached
them.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> They have no Romany words for political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
regeneration; they take no interest in the rights of
man. Let them follow their wild nomadic life, they
are satisfied. The Queen has worse subjects than our
gipsies. It is possible that tall Noah, would answer
a political philanthropist, much in the words of the
“needy knife-grinder,”&mdash;“I shall be glad to drink your
honour’s health, in a pot of beer, if you will give me
sixpence, but, for my part, I never love to meddle with
politics, sir.”</p>

<p>It is probable that tall Noah might be answered in
the well-known words of the philanthropist,&mdash;“Wretch,
whom no sense of wrongs can rouse to vengeance; sordid,
unfeeling reprobate, degraded, spiritless outcast!”</p>

<p>Then we can only say it would be very inconvenient
for the philanthropist, if he was within a mile of tall
Noah’s tent.</p>

<p>Our middags-mad consisted of tea, bread, butter, and
cheese.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> At half-past three o’clock we were once more
<i>en route</i> for the Krogkleven. Descending the hill by
the Vik Station, the master of the station came out.
We halted the donkeys for him to see them. He is
a very pleasant man. The station seems very comfortable.
It is mentioned, that there is good fishing near.</p>

<p>Reaching the shore of the Steens Fjord, a storm seemed
to be gathering. Then, as we came to a fisherman’s
house, and saw him leave with his boat, and nets, we
deemed it a sure harbinger of calm weather. Soon after
the threatened storm cleared away. We crossed the
bridge over the Steens Fjord to Sundvolden.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span></p>

<p>The magnificent cliffs of the Krogkleven were now
above us. A man pointed out the Kongen’s Udsigt
or King’s View. At Sundvolden they accommodate
travellers. The house seems large and commodious.
They have a pleasure garden, with a small fountain, but
we observed that the garden lacked taste in arrangement,
and freshness, and beauty in flowers.</p>

<p>When our cavalcade passed the large open space
in front of the station, a tall, pale, young Norwegian,
apparently belonging to the house, said to Noah, with
some authority, “Hvor fra reisen de.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Noah, who was
in advance, probably did not understand, or as usual,
did not answer every inquisitive question, and kept
pushing on. Immediately after we commenced the
steep ascent to the heights of the Krogkleven. It is
generally said, that the ascent to the Kongen’s Udsigt
takes about an hour. Very shortly afterwards, we were
overtaken by the pale young Norwegian, with an elder
companion, who took off his hat, and bowed. He said,
in excellent English, that he had seen an account of us
in the newspapers. He owned a farm in the neighbourhood,
and wished to buy one of our donkeys.
Explaining that we had already promised one as a
present, and that we should probably take the other two
to England, after a short conversation he left. The road
was most picturesque. It would have been a sad
omission, had we left Norway, without returning by this
route. In about three-quarters of an hour, we reached
the house at the top of the gorge. A woman lives in the
house, which being near the King and Queen’s View, is
used for the temporary reception of travellers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
pic-nic parties. From the large open space, at the
summit of the ascent, the main road, now level and flat,
passes through the forest towards Christiania. A track
leads through the woods on one side to the Kongens
Udsigt,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and on the other to the Dronning’s Udsigt.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
At the summit of the ascent near the house, a large
board is fixed up, upon which is painted the figure of a
navvy, with his spade; an iron box is placed under, with
a narrow slit, to receive money, for the benefit of the
men who made the road. We read <i>de haute voix</i>, for
the satisfaction of Esmeralda, the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, I have roamed o’er many lands, but never yet have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature’s face so grand and fair, as in this land, I ween.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from this cleft, how calmly grand, the varied beauties vie&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nestling hamlet, glassy lake, and mountain towering high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis true! ’tis worth a pilgrimage; but why not smooth the way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help us, my friend; yon box, your mite, it shall be, as you may.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We gave a mark. The inscription is also written in
Danish and German.</p>

<p>From this point we were now only twenty-one English
miles from Christiania.</p>

<p>As we were copying the inscription, Noah and
Zachariah, had proceeded onwards, along the road towards
Christiania.</p>

<p>After following them about a mile, we returned back
in a heavy shower of rain, to camp on the open space at
the head of the Krogkleven gorge.

DOG&mdash;THE HOBBENENGREE’S SURPRISE&mdash;THE BARON AT BŒRUMS VERK&mdash;SNAKE
KILLED NEAR OUR TENT&mdash;OUR LAST NIGHT IN CAMP&mdash;ADIEU,
CAMP LIFE.</p>

<p>On the open space near the road, our donkeys were
unloaded. The spot was surrounded by forest. It was
convenient for an early visit to the King and Queen’s
views next morning. A can of milk was procured from
the house near, for nine skillings, and with some barley-meal,
we had our aftens-mad, which consisted of gröd.
It was rather thin, but Noah pronounced it meget godt.
Whilst the tents were being pitched, the pale young
Norwegian from Sundvolden passed by our camp, and
conversed for a short time, and then continued his route.
We retired to rest at eight o’clock. The nights were
now getting cold, and damp, with heavy dews, and the
air had a wintry feeling. Night draws on quickly, and
the ferns are already changing tint.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

<p>It is Saturday, the 20th of August. We rise at five
o’clock. Noah obtained water; a fire was lighted, and
we had tea, bread, butter and cheese for our breakfast.
First we took Noah with us up a broken, rough track,
through the forest to the Kongen’s Udsigt. It was not
far from our camp. A lady and gentleman had preceded
us on horseback. The morning was dull, and
cloudy. In twenty minutes we were at the top of the
cliff, and standing on a kind of large balcony of rough
boards.</p>

<p>An old man suddenly appeared from the rocks near,
as a spider would pounce on two flies. He pointed out
different fjelds, and told many of their names. What a
magnificent extent of wild mountain, wood, and water
lay before us! The Gousta we could distinctly see,
although said to be distant seventy English miles. It
recalled to mind a period of former travel, when we once
ascended its wild, and narrow ridge, of loose rocks, to its
highest point.</p>

<p>Far below us, we could see the smooth waters of the
Tyri Fjord, the Steens Fjord and the Holz Fjord.</p>

<p>As to the wooden frame-work, it was covered with
names&mdash;the pencilled autographs of numerous travellers;
many now dead and gone. Yet, amongst the many, we
saw the name of “B. Disraeli.”</p>

<p>Half a mark as we left made it indispensably necessary
that we should shake hands with the old man of the
Krogkleven.</p>

<p>In a short time we reached the Dronning’s Udsigt.
The plateau is at a somewhat lower elevation, between
two cliffs wooded with birch and fir; whilst we sat on the
wooden seat, Noah quite agreed with ourself, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
view, though very beautiful and extensive, did not equal
the Kongen’s Udsigt.</p>

<p>As we returned to our camp, we observed on a gate
the name of Luk Grindon. At the house, the woman
showed us a horn of birch wood, about a yard long,
which she sounded for us, and ultimately Esmeralda
succeeded in blowing it.</p>

<p>When we came to our camp, Zachariah had struck our
tents, and packed the things up ready for loading. The
pale young Norwegian again passed along the road;
speaking in Norwegian, he said, “It must be very cold.”
Esmeralda got out our tin box, and we presented
him with our gipsy song. Esmeralda was full of
energy and fire. Our visitor seemed much astonished,
as she flung the things about, and occasionally
we had a cross-fire of English, and Romany,
which he did not understand. Our visitor,
apparently, did not know what to make of it as he left,
but Esmeralda meant no harm. The superabundant
energy must be exhausted, and, occasionally, like other
people, she got up on the wrong side the turf.</p>

<p>Away we all go at ten o’clock, through the charming
wild forest towards Christiania. The sky has cleared,
and it is a sunny day.</p>

<p>During our route from Stee by Lomen, Slidre, and
other places in the district of the Valders, until we
reached Aurdal, we had looked in vain for anyone
resembling a gipsy. The gipsies who visited the fairs
at Veblungsnoes generally stated they came from the
Valders, so that we had some hope, that in passing
through the district, we might meet with some of this
people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span></p>

<p>As we now refer to the Valders, it was this district
that suffered so severely in the 14th century from the
<i>Sorte Död</i> (black death).</p>

<p>It is said that a foreign vessel stranded on the
Norwegian coast with a dead crew. In a short time
a kind of plague, called the “black death,” depopulated
many districts, so that not a single inhabitant
remained.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>We soon came near a Bondegaard in the forest, and
met a young Norwegian lady; she smiled as she passed
us. “Ah, sir!” said Zachariah, “you diks as if you
would like the cova juval for your Rawnee.”</p>

<p>Again we came to open ground in the forest, and
halted at twelve o’clock. Our middags-mad consisted
of tea, sardines, bread and cheese. The oil from the
sardines had a most soothing effect on Esmeralda’s
temper, she became the perfection of amiability, and
politeness.</p>

<p>Again we were moving, at three o’clock in the afternoon;
our wanderings seemed somehow coming to a
close. “Upmyderydowno,” said Noah, as he lifted the
heavy pocket on our Puru Rawnee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span></p>

<p>Mephistopheles soon after took his violin. The echoes
of the forest were awakened with wild gipsy music, as
we tramped along at a swinging pace. Sometimes Noah
with the tambourine&mdash;sometimes Esmeralda, even the
Rye, we believe, took it occasionally, to the astonishment
of one or two stray peasants.</p>

<p>It was a sunny evening; except at one place, near
a sheet of water, we scarcely saw a house. After crossing
a picturesque river in a deep ravine, we reached
the borders of the forest, at a less distance than a
mile. An extensive view of cultivated country, and
enclosures, towards Bœrum, decided us to return to the
ravine.</p>

<p>We had noticed a steep, and lofty wooded knoll on
our left, above the broken river of the ravine. On our
return to it, we found an open space on its summit to
pitch our tents. It was a beautiful camp-ground; a
thicket of firs secluded us; we had bilberry bushes
and juniper, heath and moss in luxuriance. A steep
and lofty bank of loose stones, covered with moss,
sloped steeply to the river. From our camp we could
command a view of the road crossing the river. At
the side of the stream, on the opposite side the forest
road, some green turf gave excellent pasture for our
donkeys. The river wound its broken course round our
camp, and was lost in the deep and tangled thickets.
Esmeralda at once went down to the river, near where
the road crossed, to wash. Noah had only one shirt,
and he did not like to take it off to be washed, and
be without one. At last we gave him one of our old
white shirts.</p>

<p>Noah was delighted&mdash;“Dawdy!” said Noah, skipping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
about, when he had put it on, and had given his own
for his sister to wash. “Dawdy! mandy’s a Rye.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Presently two tourists crossed the river below, with
their knapsacks and dogs; one traveller was tall, the
other short, with sandy hair. The dogs commenced
barking at the donkeys. They seemed surprised to see
Esmeralda, apparently alone. Whilst calling their dogs
away from our donkeys, they spoke to Esmeralda; as
they looked up, they saw us looking down, from our
camp.</p>

<p>Immediately after they came up, and we found them
very agreeable; one spoke French. They had come
from Christiania, and were going to the Krogkleven.
They told us some news of the war. The tall tourist’s
English dog sat up with a pipe in his mouth, and his
master’s hat on. This formed an exception to our rule&mdash;no
smoking in camp.</p>

<p>Before they left, Noah pitched our tents. Then Esmeralda
came from her washing. They were much pleased
with two copies of our songs, and, as they left, they
said they should call on their return, but we never saw
them again.</p>

<p>The aftens-mad consisted of soup, made of our last
ham bones, Liebig’s essence, pea-flour, rice, and bread.</p>

<p>There is something delightful in the closing evening
of the wild forest; the murmuring waters are below us;
Esmeralda has gone into our tent; our visitors are gone.
As we linger near, we can perceive that our Hobbenengree
is surprised at the confusion in which we have
left our things; she has turned aside our blue curtain,
with its zig-zag braid, as she enters. Soon we hear an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
exclamation,&mdash;“Well, now, I’ll be blessed! Dableau!
If the Rye hasn’t pulled out everything, and put
nothing in! My word, I will warm somebody’s listner
just now!”</p>

<p>Reader, we must plead to being rather absent. Our
campaign is nearly ended; we are going to rest.
Mephistopheles comes in. “Sir, I have just seen an
adder in the stones below the tent.”</p>

<p>“Let the sapeau alone, Zachariah,” said we, not wishing
to hear more about adders.</p>

<p>Our camp was soon buried in sleep.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 21st August, it was a beautiful morning,
when we rose at four o’clock. Our breakfast consisted
of cold ham bones, biscuits, and English cheese. About
half-past ten o’clock we took Noah with us to Sandviken.
Our route lay through Bœrums Verk. It is an
interesting spot as belonging to one of the last Barons
of Norway. A fine chateau stands upon the crest of a hill
above the village, something in the style of Oscars-hall.</p>

<p>The Baron is a courteous and polite man. We at
once noticed the influence and effect of such a mind
upon the manners of his dependants. The Baron possesses
large iron works at Bœrums Verk. The church
near is built of bricks, and, for the first time in Norway,
we heard bells. There is something about bells which
reminds us of prayer, of peace, and contentment. At
the inn at Sandviken we found every attention we
could wish. They must have been somewhat astonished
at tall Noah, my Sancho Panza, his trowsers being
patched to the utmost extent human ingenuity could
devise; they included the best part of a coat, amongst
other additions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span></p>

<p>At the inn at Sandviken there is a sort of travellers’
room. Our middags-mad consisted of a beefsteak each,
at one mark six skillings the steak, and one bottle of
Baiersk öl at twelve skillings; we gave the pige four
skillings. Sandviken is a pleasant village, about nine
miles from Christiania. We arranged for a carriole, from
Sandviken to Christiania the next day, and, leaving, we
reached our camp, at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>Esmeralda and Zachariah had not taken any dinner,
but had waited our return. Mephistopheles had actually
killed a snake in the stones near our tent. It
measured one foot eight inches long, having a brown
back, and black belly. It was the only one we saw
in Norway; it was no myth; Mephistopheles said there
were more.</p>

<p>Two tourists, when we returned, were looking at our
tents, and talking to Esmeralda; they were going to
take the steamer, at nine o’clock that night, from Sandviken,
and were obliged to leave at once. They were
very nice young fellows. As we sat in our tents, taking
our tea, biscuits, and cheese, another party of tourists
came, and bowed to us. When we had finished, a
number of peasants congregated round our camp fire.
They did not seem disposed to leave, although we were
anxious to retire for the night. Mephistopheles at length
approached the fire in a mysterious manner, and throwing
into it some crumpled paper, walked away. They
thought it explosive, for they quickly left.</p>

<p>Now the closing scenes of summer had come, we
were told that the nights in Norway were cold, and
frosty, from the 20th to the 23rd of August. No one
will ever know our feelings as we paced, up and down,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
on this last evening of our camp wanderings. It was
the last night of our tent life in Norway. Somehow
even our donkeys seemed to take an enlarged sphere, in
the region of our affections, as we viewed them, quietly
grazing, in the picturesque ravine. A clinging affection
seemed to return, now that we were about to bid adieu
to our tents, equipage, to our gipsies, even to our
donkeys; we were now to end our camp life, with our
English gipsies, in this wild Norwegian forest.</p>

<p>We had for a time escaped from our books, which
are as whetstones to the human understanding; yet,
occasionally, they wear away the intellect, until it
has nothing left to sharpen. Is it necessary to bestow
so much time in classical study? There was a time
when it entered largely into our necessities. Now there
is a great change. Our intercourse with all parts of the
world requires a knowledge of many modern languages.
Life is short. One often doubts if competitive examinations
are useful. Some individuals, all mind, and no
energy, occasionally attain to positions, requiring more
physical energy than mind, to the country’s disadvantage,
and their own misery. Camp life is the obverse
of book study; whilst it fosters the physical energy, it
develops, and strengthens, the nervous system, and gives
a self-reliance, which cannot be comprehended by the
Kairengro, of what is called civilized life.</p>

<p>It is our last morning; we are up at four o’clock.
Our breakfast consisted of bread and cheese, and tea.
Noah was presented with another pair of trowsers, to
appear at Christiania. Taking our courier bag, and a
few books, and clothes, we left; reluctantly, we must
say. More than once, we turned, as we saw our tents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
above the ravine. More than once, as we turned, we
saw our beautiful Puru Rawnee on the greensward near
the river; we had reached the top of the ascent. As we
left the ravine, once more, we saw the form of some one
coming after us&mdash;it was Esmeralda. Our camp life in
Norway has ended.</p>

of our journey. A carriole from the Skyds Station
at Sandviken conveyed us to the Victoria Hotel at
Christiania. We had dined there on our first landing;
we went there on our return. Every attention, and comfort,
is to be found at the Victoria.</p>

<p>Our friend the Chevalier gave our gipsies a beautiful
camp ground for the tents, on a wooded knoll, near the
Christiania Fjord.</p>

<p>They were to follow us to Christiania the next morning

strolled out of the city to meet them. Our gipsies had
halted in the shade of some trees. A young officer had
stepped down from his carriage, and was speaking to
Esmeralda. The lady in the carriage had kindly offered
them camping-ground on her property. It was kindly
meant, but we had already arranged. The same evening,
our gipsies were encamped near Christiania Fjord&mdash;the
last camp of the English gipsies in Norway.</p>

<p>It seemed as if we had left the Bendigo, or the Goulborn
gold-diggings, or some scenes of the boundless Bush
forest of Australia, and had just come down to Melbourne.
Australian readers will understand the feeling.</p>

<p>Our steamer would leave on Friday afternoon. It is
the “Hero,” under command of Captain Nicholson.</p>

<p>We call at H. Heitman’s office, and showed our return
ticket, and informed him that two of our donkeys would
return with our party. H. Heitman made some objection
about finding accommodation for the donkeys, and suggested
leaving them behind. Either, said he, they must
be on full deck, or go below. The full amount for their
return passage had been paid as for horses, and they were
entitled to proper accommodation. We said we had quite
determined to take them with us.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly from Monday until Friday
the 26th August. It is not our intention to give any
description of Christiania. Excellent descriptions of all
worth seeing in this beautifully situated capital, have been
given by many English writers, and in Murray’s Guide
Book. We like Christiania, for the home-like feeling we
experienced, as we wandered through its streets, and conversed
with its people. The city has nearly, if not quite,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
doubled, its population, within the last twenty years,
Norway must advance.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> It is a country where one breathes
a true spirit of freedom. Norway exhibits an instance
of the greatest amount of liberty being quite compatible
with a monarchical form of government.</p>

<p>Sometimes we lounged at Paperviken, watching the
anglers, as we waited for the steamer, when we were going
to visit our friend the Chevalier.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Chevalier and his agreeable wife
was boundless.</p>

<p>We believe we only slept once in our room, at the
Victoria. Then our host had friends, and very pleasant
hours we spent with them.</p>

<p>One clergyman knew something of the Romany
language, and was much interested in our gipsies. Then
we had Norwegian souvenirs to purchase for our friends
in England.</p>

<p>A camp kettle was purchased for tall Noah, exactly of
similar pattern to that used by Ole Halvorsen. It was
the one great wish of Noah’s existence. Esmeralda was
not forgotten.</p>

<p>Then there was the usual lounge at that quaint old
place 17 Store Strandgade, where you are sure to find Mr.
Bennett, and some English tourists whose heads are full of
carrioles, forbuds, fast and slow stations, routes, provisions
for their Tine,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and a bewildering amount of small money
of all sorts and sizes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span></p>

<p>Then we met with our friend from the Poet’s House at
Eisbod, who had quite recovered. He dined with us,
and whiffed his cigar in the charming smoking, and
lounging-room of the Victoria.</p>

<p>Nor did we forget to look into Christopherson’s dining-room,
or take our cup of coffee under the verandah
there, with its trees before it, and the small tables and
chairs under it, reminding us of the Paris boulevards.</p>

<p>The weather was so sunny, the atmosphere so pure
and clear, and our visit rendered so pleasant by kind
friends, that with much reluctance we ordered our things
to be taken from the Victoria to the steamer.</p>

<p>Christiania, with its palace, Storthing House, Library,
Museum of Northern Antiquities and zoological collection;
its Oscarshall with Tiedman’s paintings, the old castle
of the Agershuus, must now be left.</p>

<p>Our gipsies left their last camp on the Christiania
Ford that morning. The wooded knoll above the Fjord
to the left of our engraving was the last camp of the
English gipsies in Norway.</p>

<p>Parting souvenirs had been given them by our friends
which showed the interest they had taken in them. All
our baggage was safe on board the steamer, and our
Puru Rawnee and Puro Rye were on deck.</p>

<p>The steam is up. We say farewell to our valued
friend the Chevalier. The View of Scandinavian scenery
he left in our hands, as a parting gift from his lovely
young wife and himself, will always be prized. Adieu,
also, to our friend from the “Poet’s House” at Eisbod.
Adieu, Norway, adieu!!!</p>

<p>Esmeralda’s and Noah’s tambourines may never again
be heard in the Norwegian valleys. Zachariah’s violin is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
silent. Our guitar is put up. Once more we say
farewell!!!</p>

<p>We had our usual complement of passengers, officers,
tourists, and fishermen, including our former fellow passengers,
the officer and his handsome wife, with the
Tyrolese hat and feather, and the portly gentleman, whom
we had also met at Christiania. The Birmingham bagman
had, somehow, not found his way out of the Horungerne
mountains, or wherever he might be.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_504" src="images/i_504.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LAST CAMP OF THE ENGLISH GIPSIES IN NORWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>The vessel was well ventilated, but we preferred the
“Albion;” the “Hero” being full-decked from stem to
stern, there was very little shelter, except in the smoke-room.</p>

<p>We had a number of Norwegian emigrants, going to
America, in the second-class cabins.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p>No accommodation had been provided for our donkeys.
They were left to take their chance on deck, in a cold,
damp night, at sea. When we went to see them, our
Puru Rawnee looked as if she could have kicked H. Heitman
overboard. Captain Nicholson did what he could for
us, when we spoke to him about them. No agent of
common feeling would have left them thus to take their
chance. As God is to man, so man is to animals. Kindness
is required from man to those living creatures
created for his use.</p>

<p>We could not help liking Captain Nicholson. There
was a manly spirit about him, and at the same time we
saw he possessed a kindly heart. The sailors put up by
his directions afterwards, a sort of rude tent of sails,
under which our donkeys had to balance themselves, on
the wet deck, looking exceedingly uncomfortable, and out
of place. They had been exposed all the Friday night
near the fore-hatchway, without the slightest shelter.</p>

<p>It so happened that by good fortune John Smith was
our steward, his wife the stewardess. They are wonderful
people. John Smith is slightly past the meridian of age;
a little bald, but active and stirring, and of such energy!
Always on his legs. He could far surpass the most distinguished,
and eminent acrobat, in the way he balanced
plates, dishes of fowl, bottles of champagne, anchovy
sauce, wine glasses, and dozens of other things besides.</p>

<p>“Coming, sir. Iced champagne, if you please; who
said seltzer water and brandy? Mange tak. Eating
sir! nothing but eating!”</p>

<p>Impatient tourist.&mdash;“John Smith, you have not given
me any sauce with my fish.”</p>

<p>“Caper, sir, or Worstershire? Coming, captain. Oh,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
dear! what are they about up there? Oh, here it is, all
hot. That’s right,” says John Smith, balancing hot plates,
on the tips of his fingers, as if he expected a round of
applause from the passengers. “Here you are&mdash;hot
plates, sir. Perry for you. Did you say tea? ver so
artig. Sugar and cream&mdash;Tak skal de have. The year’s
over&mdash;bang, bang. Thank goodness, here are some
empty bottles broken&mdash;I did not know what to do with
them. How could I find a father for so many dead
men? Ah, pease pudding for you, sir&mdash;half a pound?
No, not for you, sir. You, sir? Here it is on a smaller
plate, so that you should not think it was the same.
I wish I could change my name; I’m tired of hearing it.
Have you everything you want, sir?” as he looked across
the table at us. “More bread? here it is, sir,” and the
identical John Smith still pushed about without assistance,
but every finger, was worth its weight in gold.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning we came to Christiansand, and
on going ashore received two letters from the post-office,
paying eighteen skillings. They were both from some
English gipsies, who expected we should be all killed
in the war. Their ideas of geography were very loose.</p>

<p>Our gipsies are quite <i>hors de combat</i>, and wretchedly
seasick and helpless. On Sunday, our last day at sea,
the weather was rough, wet, and excessively disagreeable.
We were up at five o’clock. Only four passengers, and
Captain Nicholson, appeared at breakfast when we sat
down.</p>

<p>A Mr. McG&mdash;&mdash;, an old veteran fishing-tackle maker,
was never sea-sick, and particularly hardy. The Honourable
Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;, who had camped out in America, with
his tent, and the tall owner of the Rus Vand, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
amongst the passengers, who seem quite at home during
the voyage.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mr. V&mdash;&mdash; was a fine-looking, handsome
fellow, who had been fishing between Christiansand
and Throndjhem.</p>

<p>Amongst other passengers we had an American gentleman,
and his wife, and courier. His courier was
apparently Spanish, and was much interested in our
gipsies. He expatiated on the El Capitano of the
gipsies at Granada. The tall, intelligent American
gentleman, and his wife, we had observed at the table-d’hôte
at the Victoria Hotel.</p>

<p>Before landing, he told several of us he was going
to Ireland to examine for himself, and ascertain how
it was possible so many uneducated, bigoted, quarrelsome,
discontented, drunken people could be annually
sent to the American shores, from any country supposed
to be civilized, and under a good government.</p>

<p>Some passenger suggested, he would see the bright
side of society when he reached Ireland, the Irish being
extremely kind and hospitable.</p>

<p>The American passenger, said he would see the dark
side also. He was a tall, intelligent-looking man, and
evidently a man of observation.</p>

<p>Few of the passengers escaped sea-sickness. The
captain told our gipsies that we stood the sea exceedingly
well; our appetite was very good, and we were never
unwell all the voyage.</p>

<p>Land was announced about eight o’clock. John Smith
began lighting the saloon lamps; when they did not
light readily, he said, “God bless the Queen and all
the Royal Family!” which fervent, and loyal ejaculation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
seemed to facilitate amazingly the undertaking on
hand.</p>

<p>When the saloon was lighted up, we could enjoy the
views on the saloon panels, of Windsor Castle, and the
King of Sweden’s palace at Stockholm, until John Smith
suddenly said we had twenty-five miles of river before
landing, which apparently dulled most of the passengers’
appreciation of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Several passengers were determined to go on shore
when they had the opportunity, at any early hour in the
night. Our donkeys were put near the engine boiler for
warmth. The gipsies were dreadfully sea-sick, as we
went to bed.</p>

<p>We were told that some time afterwards John Smith,
who was at any hour, night and day, here, there, and
everywhere, had been suddenly called to the smoke-room
on deck. Some of the passengers, possibly belonging to
the Humane Society, had placed our donkeys in the
smoke-room. The biscuits on the table had rapidly
disappeared.</p>

<p>Fancy John Smith in the dim light of the deserted
smoke-room, with his head whirling round from his
attendance on passengers, politely inquiring at the door
what the gentlemen pleased to want.</p>

<p>Getting no answer, it seems he went in to see if the
gentlemen were hopelessly sea-sick, and some jovial
passenger, we were told, locked him in with his strange
companions.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>By some means our steward was released, for he supplied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
us with tea in the early morning, when we also
settled our expenses, for the gipsies, and ourselves, at
£3 9<i>s.</i> Nor did we forget John Smith’s and the second
steward’s fee.</p>

<p>We had another item for corn, for our donkeys from
Christiania&mdash;3 marks 16 skillings. We are afraid our
faithful animals had a miserable voyage.</p>

<p>Our gipsies would require the donkeys before they
reached their friends, and they ultimately found them
somewhere in Gloucestershire. The Tarno Rye was left
as a souvenir with the Chevalier, the only donkey we
believe in Norway.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>Before we left the vessel, Esmeralda discovered that her
necklace of blue and white beads, and Norwegian coins,
had been stolen. Captain Nicholson, and the stewards, did
all they could to recover it. Although not of much intrinsic
value, it was a gipsy relic, which Esmeralda prized. We
offered a reward, which was afterwards increased to £10,
but without result.</p>

<p>Fortunately, another similar necklace was in the possession
of the family. This was given to her, and we
supplied other Norwegian coins in the place of those
stolen.</p>

<p>As we left the Hero, and landed on England’s shore,
John Smith was still on the wing, for a thousand different
requirements. “Coming, sir! there is no peace for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
wicked; I must be very wicked, I know I must.” Would
that all discharged their duty as faithfully as John
Smith!</p>

<p>Reader, I gently take you by the hand. We have
met, but in the pages of this book. Yet, if you have
followed us in our wanderings, we have made some
sort of acquaintance. Perhaps we may meet again&mdash;perhaps
not;&mdash;farewell.

GIPSY LIFE&mdash;THE GIPSIES’ ORIGIN&mdash;YET A MYSTERY&mdash;ESMERALDA&mdash;NOAH
AND ZACHARIA&mdash;BEFORE THE CURTAIN&mdash;THE END.</p>

<p>We have felt that the alluring promises of our fellow
voyageurs must not be neglected. So many copies of
this record of our wanderings already ordered. Even
the Birmingham Bagman, of far-seeing speculative mind,
had ordered two copies; this in itself would give confidence.
What became of him we do not know. We
trust he did not see fit to follow us, and so get lost in the
Wild recesses of the Horungerne<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>. Again, much curiosity
has been evinced by friends, to know the incidents of our
expedition. Only a short time since, we received the
following letter, from a French gentleman, who, although
he has never been in England, is a devoted student of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
the English language. We know our friend will not be
offended if we give the letter. There is so much genuineness
of feeling about it, that the reader will not be surprised,
if it added another reason to those mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I learn always English, but I am a dull learner.
I not plod on, but I work on&mdash;gift comes by nature.
I am steady, and I am not cast down by unsuccessfulness.</p>

<p>“You are upon a journey; doubtless you shall climb
up some hill covered with snow, or you shall go into
some country which the sun dry or dries up; or you will
go into some old castle haunted by the ghosts, but you
cannot light upon such buildings, amongst the Norwegians
or in Australia.</p>

<p>“If you relate, or you give forth, which you saw, send
me that writing. Write a letter, is a hard work to me,
but translate, or read, is more facil.</p>

<p>“I am much pleased by reading the book you have
presented me, I read it over. It affords illustrations of
English character&mdash;daring, patience, energy, are the
qualities of the Englishmen.</p>

<p class="author">
“I remain, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Again, our intention has been to give some truthful
sketches of gipsy character, divested of any imaginary
fiction.</p>

<p>Esmeralda, Noah, and Zachariah are, we believe, a fair
average type of the true tenting gipsy. There has been
a scrupulous avoidance of anything tending to gloss their
faults. They are presented to the reader, rough as they
are, surrounded with only such romantic interest as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
derive from the real occurrences, incidents, and adventures,
which occurred in every-day life. We did not
leave them any the worse than we found them; indeed,
we trust that some influences may not be lost on their
future. In utilising their rough gipsy energy, no attempt
was made to struggle against the established instincts
and traditions of their race. Past experience shows the
inutility of all hope of much practical result in trying to
do so. For some purpose we know not of, they have
fulfilled, and now fulfil, a singular destiny. The facts
before us, as given by the research of many authors, in
various parts of Europe, leave no doubt as to the inscrutable
hand of Providence, in their mission upon earth. Not
before that is accomplished, will they, like other races, be
blotted out.</p>

<p>Even to the present time, their origin is a mystery, not
yet solved.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Their language, to which they have clung,
as the drowning man clutches the straw, links them
undoubtedly to a very early date, a bygone past, far
remote in the history of men and nations.</p>

<p>Esmeralda! Oh, yes, my readers; the Rye has had
painful experience of the Rawnee’s temper. She is now
seventeen years of age, five feet eight inches high, and dark
to the extreme gipsy eyes and hair. Yet she is honest,
energetic, and kindly in disposition; which covers a
multitude of faults, in these nomads of the world. She
can sing, and she likes to dance. Yet she has much tact,
control, and common sense. Few girls at Esmeralda’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
age would have ventured with the Rye, and her brothers,
over the sea to a distant land. She followed them
through all their wild wanderings.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> No! Esmeralda
has something of the Cleopatra blood, which is not
quite used up.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_514" src="images/i_514.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OLE HALVORSEN, OUR GUIDE.</p></div>

<p>Well, readers, after all, Noah is not a bad young
fellow, six feet high, without his boots, about which so
much trouble had been taken, and which cost so much.
He is in want of a wife. In camp, and out of camp, his
temper is excellent. Noah at times is chaffy&mdash;Noah
likes dancing. Noah is honest, and Noah likes his beer,
when camp rules, which are very stringent, permit it.
Noah can pack and pitch tents&mdash;can you doubt it? He
packed our donkeys through Norway, and unceasingly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
rockered his brother and sister, to use a mild term,
whilst they did their share in that interesting department,
and failed to hit his rigid regulations to a shade.</p>

<p>Well, readers, Zachariah, Mephistopheles, after all is a
nice dark young fellow when you don’t put him out of
temper, and then&mdash;we won’t say what. He can fish,
go for vand, and light the yog.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> He is honest&mdash;we
hope he won’t be hung; at the same time our experience
shows he cannot be drowned. If you attend our camp,
he can play the violin.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_515" src="images/i_515.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LAST GROUP. FAREWELL!</p></div>

<p>As we are about to make our parting adieux, do we not
hear some call for Uncle Elijah&mdash;Ezekiel&mdash;Uncle Sam of
Bosbury&mdash;the beaux of the village, the Reindeer hunters,
more than all, the pretty girl of Skeaker, and our many
peasant friends. No one answers; where is our guide to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
lead the way? Ever ready, our gallant Ole Halvorsen,
steps to the front, and for himself and them bids you all
good-by.</p>

<p>Nor shall our gipsy band be wanting at the last.
Come, Esmeralda, Noah and Zachariah&mdash;quick! Mephistopheles,
to the front. Kind readers, we bid you all
farewell.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>PRŒSTEN EILERT SUNDT’S WORKS ON THE NORWEGIAN
GIPSIES.</h3>

<p>The very important works relating to the Norwegian gipsies which
have been compiled and published for the Norwegian Government, by
Prœsten Eilert Sundt, are peculiarly interesting, not only as affording
the most recent and reliable information regarding this singular
people, but from the many details and facts which are noted, as to
their modes of life, language, religion, customs, and occupations. The
first work, “Beretning om Fante-eller Landstrygerfolket i Norge,”
published in Christiania in 1850, followed by another edition,
published, Christiania, 1852,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> contain the results, and the most
reliable information that Prœsten Sundt, then a candidate for holy
orders, could collect during two years’ patient and persevering research.
During this period, he was able to obtain with tolerable
accuracy, their probable number, and a great amount of reliable information,
relating to their habits, means of existence, and, above all,
the prospect of inducing them to abandon their ordinary mode of life.
Prœsten Sundt had many facilities to aid him in accomplishing this
undertaking, with the sanction and authority of the Norwegian Government.
He had free access to all local and public records and documents,
and thus had unusual opportunities of satisfying himself, from
time to time, and testing the truth and falsehood of the accounts given
to him by the gipsies. Again, his clerical character was a ready passport
to every village clergyman and Prœstgaard.</p>

<p>Prœsten Sundt describes the Norwegian gipsies as a race of yellowish-brown,
black-haired people, having dark, piercing eyes, and who are
of foreign and suspicious aspect. Wandering incessantly, up and down
the country, they frequent the most devious and solitary roads and
ways between Stavanger and Agershuus, and, northwards, away to
Throndjhem and Finmark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

<p>Their bands vary in number, and consist of men, women, and
children, provided, sometimes, with horses, carts, and some few
domestic animals, particularly pigs. They assume the most varied
characters, and some of them are tinkers, sievemakers, horsedealers,
and horse-doctors, and, in fact, follow many of those occupations
generally adopted by the gipsies of every country, as most compatible
with a roving life. Prœsten Sundt also states that many are plunderers
and robbers, and our own experience has clearly shown, that the
gipsies, deservedly or otherwise, have acquired a very indifferent
reputation in Norway.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> They are clearly regarded with far less favour
than in England, where the romantic life they lead has furnished endless
incidents for the novel, the drama, and the feuilleton of the press.
This, and their strange, wandering life, and mysterious origin, may
account in some degree for the passing interest they at times create
and obtains for them, here and there, <i>par souffrance</i> though it be,
occasional shelter and protection. The earliest mention, according to
Prœsten Sundt, of the gipsies in Norway, is to be found in an Ordinance
of 1589, and he is of opinion that they did not enter by way of Denmark
and South Sweden, but through the north of Sweden, and Duchy
of Finland; in fact, through North Russia.</p>

<p>Another reason stated by Prœsten Sundt, why the gipsies are regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
with a mixed feeling of fear and aversion, is on account of a
belief, of which the Norwegian peasant cannot altogether divest himself,
that the foreign-looking “Fanter” has power to bewitch both
man and beast.</p>

<p>They invest these wanderers with supernatural powers, a power
which has occasionally been attributed to some of the peaceful Laplanders,
who dwell in Norwegian Finmark; for Laing says, in his
work on Norway, page 411, when referring to the Laplanders, “The
idea of witchcraft is not entirely worn out; and the bonder have many
tales of the supernatural powers of the old fjelde women.”</p>

<p>Originally, these wanderers were all of pure gipsy blood; but in
recent times they have gradually become, in many instances, mixed
with a section of the Norwegian population, vagrant outcasts or
“Skoiern,” a class which they would at one time have refused all
intercourse with; and the result is, the occasional mixture of fair-haired
children.</p>

<p>The blending of such a strain of Norwegian blood would not improve,
but rather have a deteriorating effect. This has not happened to the
same extent in England, where the admixture has often been from
those of the better class of the English population, to the proportionate
advantage of the gipsy tribe.</p>

<p>Yet, even in England, there is a feeling among gipsies, once still
stronger than it is, against mixed marriages, and one of their own
people is generally preferred to the gorgios.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the present century, Norwegian laws relating
to gipsies have been made much less stringent, and therefore more
easily enforced. The regulations, also, with regard to all persons being
required, at a certain age, to know how to read and write, and to be
confirmed, has consigned many gipsies to prison, until they were sufficiently
instructed, as mentioned at page 301 of this work.</p>

<p>From inquiries made by Prœsten Sundt, it appears that gipsies who
remember “the good old times,” deeply lament their admixture with
other blood, and formerly, according to their accounts, a gipsy woman
who had consorted with a fair-skinned man, became “food for fire;”
that is, she was tied to a stake, and burnt. In the case of male
offenders, the old gipsy law was less severe; for they were expelled
the tribe. His doom&mdash;“fallen i brodt”&mdash;was pronounced, and he
became an outcast for ever.</p>

<p>It would appear that Prœsten Sundt’s efforts to reclaim the Norwegian
gipsies met with little success, and he found much which led
him to fear, that it is very improbable they will ever adopt the habits
of civilised life. An irrepressible desire to wander seems natural to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
the race; and even their children, adopted and well-treated by farmers
and clergymen of the country, generally run away to the woods, in
search of their relatives, as soon as they are able. From the accounts
given by Prœsten Sundt, it would seem that the Norwegian gipsies
are much lower in morality than the gipsies of some other countries.
It is a mere chance if they are baptized; they seldom, if ever, frequent
church; an impenetrable mystery surrounds the death of their aged
people. No Norwegian pastor has ever been present at the burial of a
gipsy, unless, indeed, we except such as may have died in prison.
Though Prœsten Sundt carefully questioned the gravediggers of the
parishes wherever he went, one alone was able to remember that he
had once dug a grave for a gipsy.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>Nothing being known as to what becomes of their dead, it is not
singular that the Norwegian people believe that the gipsies kill their
aged parents and relatives, to save themselves the trouble of taking care
of them. This conclusion is quite contrary to our own experience of
the English gipsies, who exhibit great affection towards their aged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
people, many of whom have survived to great ages, receiving to the
last constant care and attention.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>Prœsten Sundt says the gipsies vehemently deny that they kill their
old people, but state that, in former days, the aged people killed themselves,
and that even yet, weak folk end their days as their fathers did.</p>

<p>It may be imagined by some, that the gipsies may have been of the
same race as the nomadic Laplanders, but it is conclusively shown
that the Norwegian “Tatare” or “Fantefolket” are not in any way
belonging, either in blood, or in language, to the Laplander of Finmark.
With regard to language, it is entirely different, and we have
extracted from Prœsten Sundt’s work, published in 1852, some words
of comparison between the Norwegian gipsy and the Norwegian Lap,
having added the synonymous English, English gipsy, Hindee, and
Sanscrit words.

<p>From this comparison of words, it appears that the Romany has no
resemblance or affinity to the Lap; whilst the similarity of the Norwegian
Tater, or gipsy language, to that spoken by the gipsies of all
the countries of which examples are given, leaves no doubt that they
speak one language, peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The Norwegian gipsies are mentioned as a warlike race, travelling
with weapons, especially knives, and a dangerous weapon, called
“Tjukei.” This weapon, used by the Norwegian gipsies, is most
commonly made of Bamboo cane, and is about the length of a walking
stick, being covered with hide or leather. The middle of it, where it
is held, is covered with brass, and both ends of the “tjukei” are
heavily loaded with lead. It is formidable, and a blow from it is often
most dangerous. The Norwegian gipsies use this weapon with much
skill, twirling it round in their hand with wonderful rapidity, passing
it dexterously from one hand to the other, in an almost imperceptible
manner, a feat which enables them to continue the combat after an arm
is disabled, and also to attack their opponent where it is least expected.
The “tjukei” seems to be used in similar manner to the Irish shillaly,
with which an Irishman is so expert.</p>

<p>As the Tinklers, or Scottish gipsies, the Norwegian gipsies seem to
have had their feuds and disagreements, ending in severe fighting and
bloodshed. Their animosity and feelings of revenge were doubly
dangerous, from the uncontrolled and strong impulses of their nature,
the full extent of which can scarcely be comprehended by a kairengro,
or housedweller. Even in England, curious instances of wild revenge
have occasionally occurred, resulting in the death of one party. On
the occasion of such contentions in Norway, the women often join in
the fray, and an instance of the ferocity of the gipsy women is given by
Præsten Sundt, as occurring at Ullensaker, some time since, at a fight
which took place between two strong bands of Norwegian gipsies,
which was long remembered in the district. Two of the gipsy women
there fought with such violence and determination, that at last they
stood face to face, without a shred of clothes left for their comfort and
convenience.</p>

<p>This hostile encounter of Norwegian Tatare is similar to some of the
gipsy contests mentioned by Simpson as occurring occasionally between
bands of Scotch gipsies; One fight occurred at Rommano, on the 1st
October, 1677, between two gipsy clans&mdash;the Fawes and the Shawes&mdash;about
some spoil, after Haddington fair, when old Sandie Fawe and
his wife were both killed, and George Fawe dangerously wounded.
In the February following, old Robin Shawe and his three sons were
hung for killing Sandie Fawe and his wife. Dr. Pennecuik erected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
on the spot a dove-cote to commemorate the battle, with the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">A.D. 1683.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The field of Gipsie blood which here you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shelter for the harmless dove shall be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another fierce contest is described as having occurred in the spring
of the year 1772 or 1773, the battle originating from the encroachments
of one tribe on the district assigned to another, the fertile source
of many gipsy quarrels.</p>

<p>This battle happened near Hawick, and, according to Simpson, the
celebrated Alexander Kennedy, a handsome, athletic man, at the head
of his tribe, with little Wull Ruthven, the father-in-law of Kennedy,
and commonly known over the country as the Earl of Hell, and
Muckle Wull Ruthven, a man of uncommon stature and personal
strength, with Kennedy’s wife, Jean Ruthven, and a great number of
inferior members of the clan, males and females, including children,
were opposed to old Robert Tait, Chieftain of his horde, whose forces
consisted of Jacob Tait, young Robert Tait, three of Tait’s sons-in-law,
Jean Gordon, old Tait’s wife, and a train of youths of both sexes, of
various ages, composing his family adherents. The whole of the
gipsies were armed with cudgels, except some of the Taits, who carried
cutlasses, and pieces of iron hoop, notched and serrated, and fixed at
the end of sticks.</p>

<p>This fray appears to have been prolonged with desperate determination,
both parties observing silence, and nothing being heard but the
heavy rattle of their sticks, till at last the Earl, who had retired to get
his wounds dressed, seeing his daughter, Kennedy’s wife, dreadfully
wounded, lost heart, and, with the rest of his party, fled, leaving
Kennedy alone, with the infuriated Taits striking at him on all sides.
Kennedy, who handled his cudgel with extraordinary dexterity, judiciously
retreated to the narrow bridge of Hawick, where he was
severely pressed by the Taits, and there is little doubt they would have
killed him, but for his advantageous position. With one powerful
sweep of his cudgel, he disarmed two of the Taits, and felled another to
the ground. Kennedy’s determined stand, single-handed, without a
follower left, against all the Taits, excited a warm interest and sympathy
in his favour among the inhabitants of the town, who had
witnessed the conflict with amazement and horror. When Kennedy
broke a cudgel on his enemies with his powerful arm, they handed
him another, till at length a party of constables arrived to his relief,
and apprehended the Taits; but as none of the gipsies were actually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
slain, the Taits were afterwards set at liberty. In this battle, it was
said that every gipsy, except Alexander Kennedy, the brave chief, was
severely wounded. Simpson remarks, that what astonished the inhabitants,
was the fierce and stubborn disposition of the gipsy females,
who, when they were knocked down senseless to the ground, rose again
with redoubled vigour and energy for the fight. This conflict was
called by the English gipsies, the “Battle of the Bridge.”</p>

<p>Many other instances could be given with regard to gipsy contests;
but enough is before the reader to show that the wild, lawless life of
the Norwegian gipsies was formerly equalled by those of Great Britain,
especially in Scotland, where they often carried arms, and in some
instances, their bands were attached to some noble house, from whom
they derived occasionally protection. It is a peculiar feature of their
history, that in almost every country through which they wandered,
they have at times drawn upon themselves the strongest hostility of
the administrators of the law, and very often a policy of extermination;
yet they have still managed to survive, as a distinct people, still
clinging to many of their hereditary usages and nomadic habits with
singular tenacity.</p>

<p>Prœsten Sundt observes, that it is strange, living, as they do, in
small detached bands, they should still retain so many usages, traditions,
and habits in common. The true reason he conceives to be, that
their meetings are more frequent than we could suppose possible.</p>

<p>On the authority of an old gipsy, he states that when a band comes
to cross roads, they are accustomed to place on the right-hand side of
the one they are following, some small twigs of fir, upon which they
lay a small stone, in order that the wind may not displace them. Any
one passing who does not know the meaning of the sign, either does
not attach any importance to it, or, at most, thinks that a child has
been there at play. The object of the sign is to show to another band
where they may meet with their own people; and it is always of great
service to such good “Romany” as may require food and shelter, to
be able thus to distinguish the route by the sign called the “patron,”
placed at intervals on some gipsy trail.</p>

<p>In the winter, the Norwegian gipsies use another sign, which they
make in the snow with their whips. The sign is called by them
“faano,” and resembles a sack with the mouth closed.</p>

<p>These two signs are very useful when two bands agree to travel
in company; for, in order to avoid attracting attention, they are
obliged to have always at least one day’s journey between the two
parties; and it is by the aid of these signs, they are able to follow
each other with ease. At times, too, messengers pass between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
bands, to give timely warning should the authorities he in pursuit of
them.</p>

<p>Prœsten Sundt cautiously hesitated to believe this, as well as much
which the gipsies told him; but the authority of Borrow upon this subject,
and from the practical and certain information we ourselves have
gained, as to the use of “patrins,” leave no reason to doubt the truth
of the account given by the Norwegian gipsy.</p>

<p>In August, 1855, a royal proclamation, in reference to further efforts to
be made to control and reclaim, if possible, all Norwegian and Swedish
gipsies, gave additional evidence of the interest with which they were regarded
by the authorities, and a large sum of money having been voted
by the “Storthing,” Prœsten Sundt was enabled to publish his work,
“Forsat Beretning om Fantefolket.” Christiania: 1859.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> In this
work the author gives most minute particulars concerning the success
of his efforts, and quotes the cases of upwards of four hundred individuals,
who had been maintained at the charge of the State, during the
years 1855-9, at a comparatively trifling expense. The children had
also, in most cases, been placed with peasant families. Prœsten Sundt
gives a vivid picture of the vicissitudes in life of the gipsies, who,
however, cannot be said to be neglected by the authorities. In 1862,
Prœsten Sundt issued a small volume, entitled “Anden Aars Beretning
om Fantefolket,” which contains many interesting and additional
particulars relative to the Norwegian gipsies. This was followed by
a Special Report of 56 pages, issued in 1863, and a small volume of
113 pages, published in 1865, both relating to the Norwegian gipsies.

<p>The foregoing comparison of the gipsy language (Romanes), as
spoken by the Norwegian and English gipsies, will probably be sufficient
to satisfy our reader that both languages are the same.</p>

<p>Long as their separation has been, from whatever portion of the
world they came, the Norwegian and English gipsies are evidently one
and the same people.</p>

<p>The circumstances and causes which have separated and scattered
this singular people in detached hordes, to be wanderers in the midst of
civilisation, at present remains an impenetrable mystery.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_III">III.</h2>

<p>The following table of comparison of Romany numerals, which we
have arranged, may be interesting. The English gipsy numerals are
completed to ten, partly from Bryant’s collection of English gipsy
words, published in the “Annual Register” of 1785. We do not
know any instance of an English author, since that date, obtaining
from the English gipsies, Romany numerals so high as ten. Hoyland,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
in his work, published in 1818, gives a list from Grellmann, whose
work was translated into English by Raper, in 1785. Hoyland also
gives some examples from Bryant, but only verifies, from his own
research, the gipsy numerals up to five, and the numeral ten. Crabb,
the gipsies’ friend, who published a work in 1818, gives examples of
gipsy numerals from Grellmann, Hoyland, and Captain Richardson. No
other succeeding authors appear to have been able to make up their list
of English gipsy numerals to ten, without having recourse to Bryant or
Grellmann. Simpson, who has written an interesting work upon the
Scotch gipsies, a work evidently the result of much patient research,
gives the Scotch gipsy numerals as far as ten; but, after six, the remaining
numbers given have evidently no affinity to the Romany
language. Either the gipsies, not knowing the numerals to ten, gave
him wrong words, or he mistook the sound. Although many words of
the language may have been gradually lost, we can only wonder how
they have managed to preserve, through all their wanderings, hardships,
and difficulties, this link, fragmental though it be, to an early
past, in some long-forgotten land, whence they originally came.

<p>We have thought it well to insert in the Appendix, the following
notice from J. P. Laurent’s “Livet i Felten,”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> relative to Mr. Bennett,
so well known to almost every tourist and sportsman who has visited
Christiania during the last twenty years; and to those of our readers
who have chanced to linger in the quaint old rooms at 17, Store Strandgade,
mentioned at page 52 of this work, the notice may probably have
an additional interest.</p>

<p>“Til min store Sorg erfoer jeg her, at vor Engelskmand under mit
Ophold i Kolding havde forladt Korpset og var dragen til Norge, som
han pludselig havde faaet Lyst til at see. Da jeg anseer det meget
uvist, om han atter faaer Lyst til at vende tilbage hertil, ved Udgangen
af Vaabenstilstanden, og om han overhovedet nogensinde kommer
tilbage til Danmark, baaber jeg ikke, at jeg begaaer en Indiskretionsfejl
ved at navngive dette Menneske, der med saamegen Interesse personlig
har fulgt vor Sag i over et halvt Aar. Da han paa Udrejsen
bad Obersten om et maatte folge Korpset som civil Ledsager, naturligviis
uden at staae i nogetsomhelst Forpligtelsesforhold til Korpset,
tilbod han sig at assistere Lœgerne, og, efterat han var bleven Almindelig
kjendt, kaldte Karlene ham ‘den Engelske Doktor.’ Han hed T.
Bennett og Kaldte sig for Spög: Voluntary assistant to the medical
officers of the Danish army. Inden han forlod Korpset var han afholdt
af Alle paa Grund af sin godmodige Characteer og utrættelige Tjenstvillighed
imod Alle. Ved Retiraden fra Nörre Maestrup efter det
natlige Overfald laa en af vore Jægere syg i den Gaard, Fjenderne
havde omringet, og var ganske sikkert bleven fangen, hvis ikke Bennett
havde taget ham paa sin Ryg og slœbt afsted med ham, saalœnge han
Kunde.&mdash;Paa Maeschen<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> (<i>sic</i>) vandrede han bestandig paa sin Fod,
skjöndt man ikke vilde have nœgtet ham Plads paa Bagagevognene,
og paa lœngere Toure tog han ofte Gevœret eller Tornystren fra de
Trœtteste og bar det ufertrödent.&mdash;Naar det var, at vi laae i Bivouak,
eller i lœngere Tid maatte staae opstillede paa et eller ander Sted uden
at turde forlade samme, ilede Bennett stedse omkring og forskaffede,
hvad han kunde, til at vedergvœge Obersten og Officererne med, og
stedse bar han til det Öjemed et Par Flasker Viin i sin Tornyster.
Man kunde vedblive at fortœlle mange lignende Exempler paa den
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
Hengivenhed, hvormed han fölte sig knyttet til vort Korps, og den
rastlöse Iver, hvormed han strœbte efter at tjene Alle, og vi vare Alle
enige om, at han fortjente en offentlig Udemœrkelse.</p>

<p>“Den nœrmere Anledning til, at han fulgte med os, samt han noble
Adfœrd i den Anledning fortjener ogsaa at omtales. Da Korpset
forlod Kjöbenhavn, var det egentlig en Broder til en af de Frivillige, der
önskede som Civil at ledsage os, i Begyndelsen rigtignok Kun til Roeskilde,
men senere hile Felttoget med. Bennett troede at vœre den
Frivilliges Familie nogen Forbindtlighed skyldig og skrev hjem til den,
at naar den yngre Broder maatte gaae med, vilde han, Bennett, bestandig
ledsage denne og fölge ham hjem, naar han selv vilde. Og da
den yngre Broder forlod Korpset i Ejstrup i Begyndelsen af Juli
Maaned, ledsagede Bennett ham ganske rigtigen til Kjöbenhavn, og
blev i den Anledning forsynet med en sœrdeles smigrende Skrivelse
fra vor Oberst. Men neppe var Bennett kommen til Kjöbenhavn,
förend han uopfordret löb omkring til Officierernes Familier og bragte
Hilsener fra Mœnd og Slœgtninge, og derpaa vendte han tilbage til
Armeen og bragte os en Deel personlige Hilsener fra Hjemmet. Inden
han blev mere bekjendt, paadrog han sig flere Ubehageligheder. Paa
Als blev han antagen for en Spion, og i Haderslev vilde Politiet absolut
arrestere ham som Friskaremand til Engelskmandens store Fornöjelse.
Selv Karlene ansaae dette lange Menneske med stort, rödligt Skjœg og
hvidt Halstörklœde for en förloben tydsk Haandvœrkssvend og holdt
Öje med ham paa Marschen, indtil, de lœrte ham bedre at Kjende.&mdash;Endelig
bör jeg ogsaa ömtale, at han er Forfatter af de engelske
Vers og Krirgssange, som i afvigte Sommer fandtes indrykkede i den
<i>Berlingske Tidende</i>.”</p>

<h3>TRANSLATION.</h3>

<p>“To my great sorrow, I here learn that our Englishman, during my
stay at Kolding, has left the corps, and gone to Norway, as if he had
suddenly formed a wish to see it. As I consider his return very uncertain
previous to the expiring of the armistice, or whether he will
revisit Denmark at all; whether or no, I wish to mention the person
who has supported our cause with such personal interest for more than
half a year. When he first arrived, the Colonel asked him whether he
would accompany the army in the capacity of a civil officer, of course
without any military obligation towards the corps. He volunteered
his assistance in the medical department, and, after remaining some
time with us, and becoming generally known, the men called him
‘the English Doctor.’ After this, T. Bennett sportively called himself
‘Voluntary Assistant to the Medical Officers of the Danish Army.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
Although he has left the corps, he was esteemed by every one, on
account of his kindly character and earnest desire to be useful to everyone.
On the retreat from Nörre Maestrup, after the nocturnal attack,
one of our Jägers was lying in a yard; the enemy had surrounded it,
and he was certain of being taken prisoner, had not Bennett carried
him off on his back, and trudged away with him as far as he could.
On the march he was always on foot, notwithstanding that he might
have had a place on the baggage waggons, and on longer expeditions
he would frequently take muskets or knapsacks from the weary, and
carry them forward. When we happened to be lying in bivouac, or
were forced to stop in any place, without daring to advance or recede,
Bennett always went with the Colonel and officers to reconnoitre, for
which purpose he carried a couple of bottles of wine in his knapsack.
Many similar instances might be related of the devotion with which he
felt himself bound to our army corps, and of his ardent zeal to be
useful to all, and how all our men loved him. He deserved a public
distinction.</p>

<p>“On the last occasion he accompanied us, his noble behaviour again
deserves an excellent report. When the corps first left Copenhagen,
there was a brother of one of our volunteers, who wished to accompany
us in a civil capacity, and, indeed, reached Roeskilde sufficiently,
but his health broke down at the review. Bennett deemed it his duty
towards the volunteer’s family to write, that if the younger brother
should join, he would be a companion to him, and bring him home if
he wished it. And when the younger brother left the army, at Ejstrup,
in the beginning of the month of July, Bennett most kindly went with
him to Copenhagen, and, provided with a most flattering letter from the
Colonel, was to remain there. Scarcely, however, had Bennett reached
Copenhagen, ere he, unsolicitedly, visited the officers’ families, bringing
greetings from friends and kindred, after which he immediately returned
to the army, with many personal messages from home.</p>

<p>“Until he had become better known, he had many annoyances. At
Als he was taken for a spy, and in Hadersleben the police actually
wanted to arrest him, to the Englishman’s great amusement. Our men
even looked upon the tall man, with his fair beard and white neckerchief,
as a German mechanic who had deserted, and kept an eye on
him while on the march, until they learned to know him better.</p>

<p>“I should also finally mention, that he is the author of the English
poem and war songs, which I found last summer printed in the
<i>Berlingske Tidende</i>.”</p>

During this reign, after the battle of Hafsfjord, the great viking
“Rolf Ganger,” son of Earl Rognvald, having offended King Harald, was
banished from Norway, and, in company with many other Northmen,
sailed with a fleet of vessels to the Hebrides, and from thence to Normandy,
where the Northmen, about the year 896, obtained possession of
Rouen, and Rolf Ganger, afterwards embracing Christianity, became Duke
of Normandy.&mdash;<i>Histoire de la Conquête de l’Angleterre par les Normans</i>,

The king ascends the throne as King of “Sweden, the Goths and

Laing defines a Viking and a Sea-king thus:&mdash;a sea-king, one connected
with a royal race&mdash;either of the small kings of the country or of the
Haarfager family, and who by right received the title of king as soon as
he took command of men, although only a ship’s crew, without having any
land or kingdom. The Viking is a term not connected with the word
kóngr, or king: the vikings were merely pirates&mdash;alternately peasants and
pirates&mdash;deriving the name Viking from viks, wicks or inlets on the coast,
where they harboured their long ships or rowing-galleys. Laing says every
sea-king was a viking, but every viking was not a sea-king.</p></div>

The pannikins hold about a pint and a half, and each weighs 6 oz.
They have a small loop handle on each side, which folds down, and is
covered with leather, so that the pannikin can be carried when filled with
hot tea. This kind of pannikin, first suggested to us by Mr. Whymper,
whose plan it is, we prefer to any other we have seen for weight, size, and
convenience.</p></div>

We have recently purchased a new and ingeniously contrived “cooking
canteen,” designed by Lieutenant Lecky, H.M.S. <i>Asia</i>. This canteen may
be inspected, and is for sale at 79, Mark Lane, City. It weighs 22 lbs.,
and its cost is two guineas. We however think it more adapted for a
military encampment than for an expedition like our own. One large
light fish-kettle, frying pan, and tin boiling kettle, were amply sufficient
for all requirements; and after the wear and tear of our wanderings in
Norway, they are still serviceable and fit for another expedition.</p></div>

Monsieur Bataillard, in his interesting work “Nouvelles Recherches
sur l’Apparition et la Dispersion des Bohémiens en Europe,” says that the
earliest mention of Taters in Norway is found in a law of 1589. His
opinion is that they did not enter Norway by way of Denmark and South
Sweden, but through North Sweden and the Duchy of Finland, that is to
say by the north of Russia. This opinion appears to have been supported
by Presten Eilert <span class="smcap">Sundt</span>. M. Bataillard, therefore, considers that the
Norwegian gipsies were not part of the numerous hordes who entered the
south of Europe subsequently to the year 1417. M. Bataillard is the author
of a work entitled “De l’Apparition et de la dispersion des Bohémiens en
Europe,” published in 1844, and now out of print. The same author has
recently published another interesting and valuable contribution, entitled
“Les Derniers travaux relatifs aux Bohémiens dans l’Europe Orientale,”
published 1872. In this work Monsieur Bataillard gives a most able review
of the works of various authors who have written upon the gipsy people
wandering in Eastern Europe.</p></div>

It may be that the noble descendant of the Penningtons owed his
almost miraculous escape, to his possession of the curiously-wrought
enamelled glass cup, given by King Henry the VIth after the battle of
Hexham, 1463, to his ancestor, Sir John de Pennington, knt., with a prayer
that the family should ever prosper, and never want a male heir, as long as
the cup remained unbroken. The cup is called the “Luck of Muncaster,”
and Muncaster Castle, and its long broad winding terrace, commanding
magnificent views over the valley of Eskdale, is one of those enchanted
spots which we meet with in the picturesque county of Cumberland. It is
singular that another family in Cumberland also possess a similar talisman,
to which is attached a rare value, “The Luck of Edenhall,” belonging to
the ancient family of Musgrave. It is an old enamelled drinking glass,
said to have been seized in olden time by a Butler of Eden Hall from
some fairies he surprised dancing near St. Cuthbert’s well in the Park.
The glass had been left by the fairies near the brink of the well, and the
fairies, failing to recover it, vanished with the words&mdash;</p>

Although the account, singular as it is, receives very general credence,
and the place of sepulture, on the roof of the mansion near Hyde Park, is
even pointed out, we must say, that a literary friend, who devoted some
time to the inquiry, discredits the truth. In a letter written by a near
relative of the titled possessor, which we have seen, it is stated, that the
account is correct, and it is also stated, that the property, for that reason,
was purchased for a lower price. The matter therefore remains involved
in some mystery. We have since been informed by a clergyman, that he
well remembers being told, of the sepulture of a body, on a house near
Clapham Junction, on the London and South-Western Railway. Another
instance has also been mentioned to us, as occurring in one of the midland
counties. At the last moment, but in time to find a record in this note,
a friend has kindly sent us the following facts, illustrative of our page
heading, “Strange Wills.” At Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, a pleasantly
situated place on the High North Road, about eleven miles from Hertford,
a resident, Henry Trigg, having peculiar ideas about the resurrection, left
his property to his heirs, upon condition, and in trust, that they put him in
an oak coffin, and placed his body on the rafters of his barn, attached to
the Old Castle Public House, in the parish of Stevenage. There he was
placed in 1724, and there he now remains. In the time when coaches
stopped at the Old Castle Public House, there were many travellers on the
Great Northern Road. The old oak coffin was then a lion of the place, and
brought grist to the landlord of the inn. Even now it is occasionally
visited by the curious.</p></div>

The carriole, called in Norwegian “Karjol,” is a light Norwegian
carriage, with long springy shafts, admirably adapted for travelling in a
mountainous country. A carriole will only accommodate one traveller, whose
legs can be stretched out at full length, in a horizontal position, and a long
leather apron protects them from rain. A small flat board leaves just
sufficient space for a portmanteau or trunk, which should not exceed
thirty-four inches in length, fifteen inches in breadth, and eleven inches high,
with standing-room for the “skydskarl” (boy), who accompanies the pony
during the posting-stage. Carrioles may be hired or purchased from the
Christiania Carriole Company, 17, Store Strandgade, and, being very light,
are easily taken on steamers, across lakes and fiords, to the next posting-station,
from whence the traveller continues his land route with another
pony. Carrioles are now often used by ladies, and are more easy and convenient
than the stolkjœrre, a light cart, which, being less expensive to hire,
is occasionally used by travellers as a means of conveyance.</p></div>

George Parkes Bidder was born about the year 1800. So wonderful
were his mental powers for giving ready solution to the most difficult
questions in arithmetic, without the aid of pen or pencil, that he was known
in early life as the “Calculating Boy.” Among the many instances of his
ready ability, he once answered in a very short time the following question:&mdash;“Supposing
the sun be 95,000,000 of miles from the earth, and that it
were possible for an insect, whose pace should be seven and a-half inches
per minute, to travel that space, how long would it take him to reach the
sun?” Bidder became a civil engineer, and was at one time President of

To the left of our route, near Svatsum, a young English naval gentleman,
travelling in Norway in 1853, was so pleased with the scenery of the
country, that he purchased a small farm, and resided there for five years,
fishing in the Rœv Vand (Fox Lake) and other lakes, and exploring the
fjeldes with his tent and gun. To this incident the neighbourhood of
Svatsum has become associated with the author of a small but interesting
book, published in 1863, entitled, “Recollections of a Five Years’ Residence
in Norway.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">40</a>
The lake fishing in the fields beyond Svatsum is said to be very good.
Öret (Nor., trout) sometimes weigh 10 lbs. The Rœv Vand is associated
with a fishing adventure, an account of which we have never met with but
in “Recollections of a Five Years’ Residence in Norway,” by Henry T.
Newton Chesshyre, who gives the narrative <i>in extenso</i>. The circumstances
are, briefly, as follows:&mdash;On the 16th of August, 1715, two brothers, who
were students, on a fishing excursion, landed from their boat upon an island
of barren rock, fifteen yards wide by twenty yards long, in the Rœv Vand.
Whilst there, a strong gust of wind, suddenly drifted the boat, to the shore
of the lake. Neither of the brothers could swim. Lightly clad, they
remained nine days, in sight of their fishing boat, and faithful dog, who
had continued watching their things, and occasionally appeared on the
gunwale of the boat, and whined piteously. They had put up a rude
hovel of loose stones, which afforded them little shelter in an exposed
situation on a lake 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. After the ninth
day, they could not see their dog, and supposed he had died of grief and
starvation. The dog, it appeared afterwards, had left, and, finding his way
home, by constant howling and importunity, gave the idea that some misfortune
had happened. On the night of the twelfth day, the two brothers
embraced each other for the last time, as they believed, and awaited death.
Their only sustenance had been about an ounce of wild sorrel each day.
Suddenly, they heard the tramp of horses and the sound of voices on the
edge of the lake. One brother had just strength enough to make himself
heard, and they were rescued. The two students, after some weeks’ illness,
recovered; but their faithful dog, Sikkert, died from the effects of his long
fasting, and found a resting-place in the students’ garden.</p></div>

Three excellent sermons referring to marriage, entitled “A Good Wife
God’s Gift,” “A Wife Indeed,” and “Marriage Duties,” were published in the
“Spiritual Watch” in 1622, by the eminent theologian, Thomas Gataker, B.D.
He was the author of many learned works, and his annotations on “Marcus
Antoninus” are well known to scholars. Thomas Gataker was born in
1574, of a very old and ancient family, still retaining their ancestral heritage
of Gatacre, in Shropshire. The former Hall of Gatacre was built of
stone, three sides of the exterior of the mansion being entirely covered with
a glaze of greenish glass. It has puzzled many to account for the method
by which the walls received their vitreous coating, effectually preserving
the stone from the action of the weather. The foundation of a building on
the estate, where the glass is supposed to have been made, still retains the
name of the “Glass House.” We have in our possession some of the stone,
with its covering of glass, given to us by one of the family. The roof of
the mansion is said to have been supported by an enormous oak tree,
turned upside down. This interesting relic of former ages was pulled
down during the last century, and replaced by the present large and
spacious brick-built Hall of the Gatacres of Gatacre.</p></div>

management of Mr. Forbes, by whose energy the nikel mines were first
developed. The mines had many years previously been worked for copper.
The nikel ore falling in value, the Espedal Works were sold to a Norwegian
company. The scenery of the Espedal is wild and beautiful, and
the lake is well stocked with trout.</p></div>

Patron, Sundt’s Norwegian gipsy, signifying a leaf, a signal; Patrin,
Paspati’s Turkish gipsy, a leaf; Patrin, in the “Italien Lingua Zingaresca”
of Francesco Predari; Patrin, in Hoyland’s “English Gipsy;” Patrin in
Bischoff’s “Deutsch-Zigeunerisches;” Patrin, in the “German Gipsy
Vocabulary” of Dr. Liebich. Patrin is also given as German gipsy by
Grellmann. The word is used by gipsies, signifying a signal or sign on the
gipsy trail to indicate to other gipsies, who understand this silent language,
the route they have taken. The word is pronounced occasionally with
some slight variation, as patteran, patrin. Borrow, in his admirable work,
“The Zincali; or An Account of the Gipsies in Spain,” vol. i., p. 37, uses
“Patteran.” We have spelt the word as nearly as possible as pronounced
by the gipsies of our party. Patrins of chor (gip. grass) are commonly put
by gipsies. Some gipsies we have met with used to put patrins for their
favourite blind dog, “Spot,” when he had strayed or lingered far behind.
A few blades of grass or leaves crushed in the gipsy female’s hand, and cast
on the road, were scented out by the blind animal, who ultimately reached
the encampment. Spot would occasionally remain all day in charge of the
tents, and would never steal a morsel of the hobben (food), though he were
famishing; “but,” said the gipsy female, “dogs brought up in the tents
are like nobody else’s dogs, and they know our language as well as we do
ourselves.” Poor Spot strayed one day, and, losing the trail, they never
saw him again.</p></div>

The gipsy word “chor,” signifying grass, is sometimes pronounced by

and “Tschar.”</p></div>

and river, a few yards from our camp, was sometimes called by us the
“Hanging Rock,” sometimes the “Hanging Stone,” and very often the
“Leaning Stone.” In future mention in these pages we shall call it the
“Leaning Stone.” This large stone was so overhanging on the side towards
Ormein, that it formed an excellent shelter for the traveller to rest
and light his bivouac fire. Occasionally the “Leaning Stone” brought to
mind the “Druids’ Stone” we once sketched, at Stanton, near Monmouth;
sometimes it reminds us of the famous “Boulder, or Bowder Stone,” in the
romantic gorge of Borrowdale, near “Castle Crag” and Derwent Water, in
Cumberland; but the “Bowder Stone” has this difference, that it overhangs
on both sides, and has a narrow aperture underneath, through which
two persons or lovers, joining hands, it is said, will have their secret wish.
Perhaps the Leaning Stone of the beautiful valley of the Sjiriaglns has
some such mystic power&mdash;who knows? We leave it to some other
wanderer over fjeld and fjord to discover.</p></div>

Alnus glutinosa.&mdash;This tree is often met with on the banks of the
rivers of England and Wales, as in Norway. Occasionally we have met, in
a secluded valley in Wales, a party of “cloggers,” who have bought a
quantity of this wood, and are converting it on the spot into clogs. They
are cloggers out for the summer. The alder wood is being worked up
under a light awning, or half-tent sort of abri, from the rain and sun. The
cloggers generally sleep at some house until the stock of wood is converted
into men’s, women’s, and children’s clogs, which are consigned from time to
time, by the nearest railway, to Lancashire. The alder wood is valuable
for piles for bridges, as it lasts long under water. The Rialto at Venice is
built on alder piles. The bark and leaves are useful for dyeing and tanning
leather, and in staining sabots in France, which are also made of this
wood. Alder wood is light in weight, and easily worked. The dark
bark and foliage of the spreading branches of the tree, which overhangs
the river’s edge, gives picturesque effect to many a Norwegian river scene.</p></div>

What is meant by a czardas, or csárdás, as it is usually spelt in the
Hungarian language? It is a celebrated Hungarian dance. The Magyar
peasant seldom dances anything else. The csárdás is a national dance of
Hungary, as much as the sailors’ hornpipe is of England. We give the
following description of the csárdás, from the interesting work of Arthur J.
Patterson, “The Magyars; their Country and Institutions,” vol. i., p. 194,
published by Messrs. Smith, Elder &amp; Co. in 1859:&mdash;“Its name is the adjective
form from “csárdá,” which designates a solitary public house; an
institution which plays a considerable part in all romantic poems or romantic
novels whose scene is laid in Hungary, as a fitting haunt for
brigands, horse-thieves, gipsies, Jews, political refugees, strolling players,
vagabond poets, and other melodramatic personages. The music of the
csárdás is at first slow, solemn, and, I may say, melancholy. After a few
bars, it becomes livelier, which character it then keeps up, occasionally
becoming very fast indeed, and at last ends in a delirious whirl of confusion.
The movements, of course, correspond. The dance opens with a
stately promenade; then, as the music quickens, each couple take a twirl
or two, and breaking away brusquely from one another, continue a series of
pantomimic movements, now approaching coquettishly like parted lovers
desiring reconciliation; then, as if the lady thought she had given sufficient
encouragement, she retreats with rapid but measured steps, while her
partner pursues, and, gradually gaining on her, again seizes her waist; they
whirl swiftly round two or three times, and then, breaking away, continue
the pantomime as before. What makes the csárdás unrivalled is its
variety. One seldom sees the couples perform exactly the same figure at
the same time.”</p></div>

The splendid vestiges of the Roman baths, called “thermæ,” “banios,”
or hot baths, at Rome, attest their former extent and magnificence. The
Romans began their bathing with hot water, and ended with cold&mdash;the
hot, “caldarium;” the tepid, “tepidarium;” the cold, “frigidarium.”
Vast numbers of magnificent baths were erected by the Roman emperors.
They had spacious porticos, rooms for athletic exercises, halls for the
declamation of poets and the lectures of philosophers. Perhaps the most
interesting remains of Roman baths in England are those discovered in the
buried city of Uriconium, or Wroxeter, on the banks of the river Severn,
about six miles from Shrewsbury, in Shropshire. For an admirable account
of this city, supposed to have been taken by force, with much carnage,
plundered, and burnt, between about the year 420 and the middle of the
fifth century, we refer our readers to a work of great antiquarian research,
published in 1872, entitled, “Uriconium: A Historical Account of the
Ancient Roman City,” by Thomas Wright, M.A., F.S.A., &amp;c., and also to
the concise and useful work, “The Roman City of Uriconium,” by J.
Corbet Anderson. We believe that the private subscriptions, although considerable,
which have been collected for excavation, are now all exhausted;
and, unless Government aid is given, it is improbable that the excavations,
however interesting, can be resumed. The number of relics of the buried
city, a very small portion of which has been explored, show the antiquarian,
we may say, historical importance of further research. Randall, in his interesting
and beautifully illustrated work, the “Severn Valley,” published
(1862) by Virtue, says&mdash;“As excavations proceed, the plan of the city unfolds
itself.... The forum, the baths, the market-place, and the sites of
public and private buildings become clear;” and again the author says,
“but with ruins, three miles in circumference, much remains to be explored.</p>

There is a favourite Hungarian melody, called by the Magyars the

and Transylvania,” published in 1855, says&mdash;“I am now more than
ever convinced that none but a gipsy band can do it full justice. The effect
of the melancholy, plaintive sounds with which it begins, increased by the
final discords which the gipsies introduce, and of the wild burst of passion
which closes it, must depend as much on the manner of its execution as on
the mere composition.”</p></div>

Of the Norwegian winged game, the “capercailzie,” or, as the male
bird is called in Norsk, “tiur,” is, perhaps the finest, varying from nine to
sixteen pounds in weight. They feed much on the cranberry, red whortleberry,
bilberry or bleaberry, wild strawberry, raspberry, and on juniper
berries, insects, and also on leaves of the Scotch fir and spruce pine. Then
there are the ptarmigan of two kinds&mdash;the “fjeld rype,” mountain ptarmigan,
and the “skov rype,” or wood ptarmigan; also the “hjerpe,” hazle
hen, hazle grouse&mdash;the handsomest of the grouse species&mdash;the “aarfugl,”
black cock or black grouse; also “raphöne,” partridges; “vagtel,” quail;
and “rugde,” woodcock. Partridges and quails are not numerous. We
refer those who wish to know more about the game birds of Norway to a

Fowl of Sweden and Norway,” by L. Lloyd, author of “Field Sports of

“Scenes from the Snow Fields, or the Upper Ice World of Mont
Blanc,” by Edmund T. Coleman, was published, at the cost of three
guineas each copy, by Messrs. Longman, in 1859. Mr. Coleman, who is
still a member of the English Alpine Club, has since extended his travels
to British Columbia and California. In 1868, in company with Messrs.
Ogilvy, Stratton, and Tennent, he finally succeeded in making the first
ascent of Mount Baker, and planting the American flag on its highest peak,
which he named “Grant’s Peak,” in honour of the President of the United
States. Mount Baker is 10,613 feet above the level of the sea, and is the
most northerly of the great cones of the Cascade range, being only fourteen
miles from the boundary line dividing America from English possessions.
Like another “snowy Olympus,” it towers above the rest, as the sentinel of
a solitary land. The justly celebrated and successful American serial,
“Harper’s New Monthly Magazine,” of November, 1869, page 793, contains
a most interesting article, entitled “Mountaineering on the Pacific,” by Mr.
Coleman, with numerous engravings from Mr. Coleman’s drawings, descriptive
of his successful ascent. Illustrations and a paragraph referring
to the ascent also appeared 29th June, 1872, in a number of the <i>Illustrated

So singular was the appearance of the ice cliff, rising on the glacier
and towering above us in the waning light of a Norwegian summer’s eve,
that after describing it to an Alpine traveller of much experience, we wrote
to our guide, and the following extract from Ole’s letter, dated 12th April,
1872, may be interesting:&mdash;“I am apt to think that the <i>Ice Cliff</i>, which I
perfectly well remember, consists of rock on the side we did not see. I can
hardly believe it to be entirely of ice. It certainly seemed so to us from
the view we had at it; but there must be rock on the other side, I should
think.”</p></div>

Exposed to the heavy snows of winter and the storms of each
changing season, some of the frail bridges which span the mountain torrent
of many a deep and narrow gorge are very insecure. Many districts are
remote, and the bridges seldom used. This danger to travellers has not
escaped the attention of the Norske Turistforening. A melancholy accident
occurred, just before we left Norway, to a young gentleman named
Wright, travelling with his party in the north-west of Norway. All had
safely passed across a wooden bridge but his sister. She was afraid to
venture. Her brother was testing the stability of the bridge to remove
her fears, when a portion gave way. The tourist fell with it into the
torrent below, and lost his life. We were told he was afterwards buried
at Bergen.</p></div>

When we visited the Rjukan fos some years since we were certainly
under the impression that the name applied to a rock on the face of the
precipice above the fall, where the lover slipped at the first meeting after a
long absence, and was lost in the abyss below. The name may probably be
derived from the footpath, which at that time was very similar to a ladder,
and Williams, in his work “Through Norway with a Knapsack,” calls it
“Marie Stige,” saying in a note, “stige” is the Dansk and Norsk for ladder;
and placing the article “en” at the end of the word, as is usual, it becomes
stigen, the ladder, hence the local name, “Marie Stigen,” the Mary’s
Ladder, which most English writers have misunderstood or Germanized into
“Marie Stein,” or Mary’s Rock; others spell it “Marie Stegen,” which,
translated, signifies Mary’s fry, Mary’s roast meat. In Murray it is
called Mari Stien. The legend has associated a romantic interest with
the Rjukan fos.</p></div>

Before we left the Bygdin Lake, a rumour reached us, that the poet
Vinje was dead. His spirit had departed to some far-distant world. It
was quite true: Aasmund Olafsen Vinje died 30th July, 1870, at Sjo, in the
parish of Gran, Hadeland. He was born of poor parents, in the parish of
Vinje, in Thelemarken, about 1818. The exact year of his birth appears
to be doubtful. A soft and melancholy stillness seemed to pervade the
air, as if the departed spirit of the poet lingered near his once favourite
haunt. It glided silently over the Sletmarkhö, and was for ever gone.</p></div>

This author, by many ranked second to Shakspeare, was born 1574,
and rising by his own perseverance, and energy of mind, became, in 1619,
Poet Laureate. Many of the dramatic pieces of Jonson were masques performed
before the King and Court. Jonson, when he was appointed Poet
Laureate, made a journey on foot from London to Scotland. When met, it
is said, by Drummond of Hawthornden (to whom, amongst other friends, he
paid a visit), Drummond said, “Welcome, welcome, royal Ben!” to which
Jonson aptly replied, “Thank you! thank you, Hawthornden!” “The
Masque of Metamorphosed Gypsies” was presented to King James at
“Burleigh,” “Belvoir,” and Windsor. A printed copy we have is dated
1621. Jonson wrote to the last; but, after some years of great literary
success, and prosperity, he died, 1637, in needy circumstances, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey, the only inscription on the poet’s tomb
being “O rare Ben Jonson!”</p></div>

Some gipsies have an idea that if they have their likenesses taken, it
does them an injury. We have known one gipsy who would not be taken.
On one occasion, when a gipsy had allowed his photograph to be taken to
oblige us, he said, “Well, sir, don’t you lose something from you, and are
never so well afterwards?”</p></div>

Shelley, the poet, during his tour in 1814, being at Paris, purchased a
donkey to carry his baggage, and, by turns, his two <i>companions de voyage</i>,
Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, and her relation, a lady friend. They all
proceeded towards Charenton, when Shelley, who had, probably, made an
indifferent purchase, discarded the donkey, and bought a mule for ten
napoleons. With many adventures, the party at length reached Troyes, and
Shelley, having sprained his ancle, the party accomplished the rest of the
journey in an open carriage.&mdash;“Shelley and his Writings,” by Middleton.
1858. Shelley was born 1792, and was drowned, 8th July, 1823.</p></div>

good; for instance, the French gipsies use “ladscho” and “mischdo.” The
Turkish gipsies use “latcho,” good, and the Norwegian gipsies “lattjo,” good.
Borrow, in his work, “The Zincali; or, an Account of the Gypsies of
Spain,” gives “kosko” as the English gipsy for “good.” Colonel Harriot
has given “kashto” and “kashko”; and for “good-night,” “kashko rati,”
as used by the gipsies of North Hampshire.</p></div>

In a work, entitled “The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century,”
translated by Dr. Babbington from the German of Dr. Hecker, published
in 1833 by A. Schloss, 109, Strand, London, it is stated that the contagion
was carried from England to Bergen, where the plague broke out in the
most frightful form, and throughout the country, not more than a third of
the inhabitants being spared. The sailors found no refuge in their ships,
and vessels were often seen, driven about, on the ocean, and drifting on
shore, whose crews had perished to the last man. This reminds us of the
skeleton crew of the “Glenalvon,” bound from Charleston to Sydney, met
with by Captain Martin, of the “Lancaster,” an account of which appeared
in the newspapers of last October. Such tales of the sea, dreadful in their
reality, are closely associated with the Phantom ship said to sail the stormy
seas near the Cape of Good Hope, which has often furnished an interesting
subject for the sailors’ night-watch yarns of spectral fancy.</p></div>

We have been told that the Norwegian gipsy is sometimes called an “earth-digger.”
Possibly at times, in winter, they may shelter themselves in holes as some
of the gipsies do in Transylvania. We have only been able to ascertain one instance
of “gipsy earth dwellings” in England. Our informant, now advanced in life,
remembers, when shooting in the winter, about the year 1818, on Finchley common,
near London, to have seen excavations in the common used as dwellings by gipsies.
One kind of earth-dwelling, he remembers, was formed by sinking a deep hole, from
the bottom of which an excavation made at right angles served the gipsies for sleeping
purposes. Another kind of earth-dwelling he then remembers was an oblong excavation,
at no very great depth, below the surface of the soil, having an arched covering
above ground formed with branches cut from the pollard oaks near, and covered with
turf. In a paper read before the Anthropological Society of London, by Dr. R. S.
Charnock, F.S.A., F.R.G.S., on the 4th May, 1866, entitled “The peoples of Transylvania,”
an interesting account is given of the gipsies inhabiting that country. Dr.
Charnock says that the gipsies of Transylvania ordinarily dwell in tents in the summer,
and their winter habitation are holes in the earth which they excavate for the purpose.
The holes are usually from eight to twelve feet deep. Dr. Charnock also says that
many of the gipsies have fixed habitations in Transylvania, and keep wine shops and
public-houses. The dwellings are usually situate on the outskirts of a town or
village. Some dwell in the suburb of the capital of Vásárhely. A little hill outside
the town of Klausenberg is covered with gipsy dwellings. The located gipsies are
generally honest, and their females virtuous. Many of the located gipsies are skilled
in music. Dr. Charnock states that the number of gipsies in Transylvania is
variously estimated at 78,923 and 60,000.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_144" href="#FNanchor_144" class="label">144</a>
Our enquiries incline us to believe that in England gipsies usually seek the baptismal
rite for their children, and that their dead are generally buried in consecrated
ground. On some occasions the attendance at a funeral has been large, and a tomb
or grave-stone erected to the memory of the gipsy who sometimes was said to be a
gipsy king, as, for instance, James Boswell, buried at Rossington, near Doncaster,
1708-9; also the instance of a gipsy said to be a gipsy king mentioned in “Notes and
Queries” as having been buried at West Winch, Norfolk. In the “Gentleman’s
Magazine” mention is made of Henry Boswell, said to be a gipsy king, who died in
affluent circumstances, and was buried in 1687, at the parish of Wittering. We are
also informed that a grave-stone marks the grave of a gipsy in the churchyard of
Winchcombe, Gloucestershire. In the churchyard of Calne, Wiltshire, a handsome
tomb was erected to the memory of Inverto Boswell, said to have been the son of a
gipsy king, who was buried there, 1774. In “Notes and Queries,” series 4, vol. 4,
page 206, it is stated that a grave-stone erected on the grave of a gipsy buried in the
churchyard of Coggeshall, Essex, has the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">“In<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet I have left them to lament. But why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lament for death? ’Tis gain in Christ to die!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We could cite many other instances, if space permitted; and we believe that the non-burial
of their dead in consecrated ground in England has occurred only under very
exceptional circumstances.</p></div>

Gipsies have occasionally attained to a very advanced period of life. Margaret
Finch, who, during the greater part of her life, wandered over England, at length
settled at Norwood, and died at the age of 109. Her fame as a fortune-teller brought
many visitors to her camp to consult her, and she had the title of queen of the gipsies.
She was buried at the parish of Beckenham, in Kent, on the 24 Oct., 1740. Her
funeral was said to be attended by two mourning coaches, a funeral sermon was
preached on the occasion, and a great concourse of people attended her funeral. It is
stated in “Dugdale’s England and Wales,” that, from the habit of sitting on the
ground with her chin resting on her knees, her sinews at length became so contracted,
she could not rise from that posture, and after her death they were obliged to enclose
her body in a deep square box. At an inn called the “Gipsy House,” at Norwood,
her picture adorned the sign-post. Another instance is that of “Liddy the Gipsy,”
who not many years since wandered through Radnorshire and the adjoining counties.
She is said to have danced at a wedding at the age of 100. Towards the close of her
life, she travelled with a knife-grinder, sleeping at the towns on her route. She was
of active, restless, blithesome temperament, and was lost in a snow drift whilst crossing
through Radnor Forest, at the age, it was said, of 104. We afterwards questioned
one of her people, and he said she was only 102.</p></div>

This government proclamation is noticed by the Rev. Frederick Medcalfe in
“The Oxonian in Thelemarken,” vol. 1, page 160, who says&mdash;“I make a point in
all these spots of examining any printed notice that I may come across as being likely
to throw light on the country and its institutions. Here, for instance, is a government
ordinance of 1855 about the Fantefolk, otherwise Tatare or gipsies. From this
I learn that some fifteen hundred of these Bedouins are moving about the kingdom,
with children, who, like themselves, have never had Christian baptism or Christian
instruction. They are herewith invited to settle down, and the government promises
to afford them help for this purpose; otherwise, they will still be called ‘gipsies,’
and be persecuted in various ways.”</p></div>

The poet’s right name is Aasmund Olafsen Vinge. The poet has signed
“Olsen” instead of “Olafsen,” probably because the name would not scan otherwise
in the last line. The poet is said to have been born, 6 April, 1818, in a poor cottage
(huusmands plads) in the parish of Vinge Thelemarken.</p>

<p>In his early youth his library consisted of his Bible, some of Holberg’s works, and
a few religious books. Most of his early days were spent in tending goats and cattle
in the woods, where he received those strong impressions of the wonders of nature and
the beauties of mountain scenery which formed the poet of after-years. When he was
grown up, he received sufficient instruction to become a teacher at Mandal, where he
studied navigation and commerce.</p>

<p>At a comparatively late period of life, in 1850, when he was 32 years of age, he
entered as a student of the university of Christiania, and, taking his degree in law,
commenced practice as a solicitor.</p>

<p>The poet, as might be expected, was little suited to the practical requirements of
the profession, and his peculiar views placed him in antagonism with the state of
literature, religion, and politics of the time. The Danish book-language spoken by
the educated classes, and now used as the language of literature, did not please him;
and he strenuously advocated a return to the old Norsk or Icelandic language. Through
the interest of friends, Vinge had obtained an appointment in a government office,
which gave him the absolute necessities of life; but this he lost in consequence of his
persistent attacks upon the unity of Norway and Sweden under one king, forgetting
that the union of the two countries gives them an additional element of power in the
north.</p>

<p>In 1858 Vinge published a weekly periodical, the “Dolen,” which, with occasional
interruptions, he continued for eight years, contributing articles on various subjects,
almost entirely written in the ancient Norsk. In this periodical most of his poetry
was first published.</p>

<p>As a poet, he is said to excel more particularly in idylls; and as a prose author, by
his genial humour. During a residence in Scotland and England in 1862 and 1863,
he wrote in English “A Norseman’s View of Britain and the British,” published 1863.
With much originality of thought, it is encumbered with false conclusions and extreme
views. The work consists of a series of sixteen letters, and is most interesting as an
analysis of the poet’s mind, who might have cast his fate on more peaceful waters.
They are in striking contrast with “De l’Avenir politique de l’Angleterre (England’s
political future) par le Comte de Montalembert,” published 1856. Yet, withal, there
is a freshness in the northern poet’s views. They are the real emanations of real and
earnest thought, and so command respect, attention, and consideration. Of the society
of England, we are sorry to say, Vinge took a desponding view, forgetting, as the lofty
mind of Milton speaks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Orders and degrees jar not with liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But well consist.”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his letters on England, Vinge, in order to give a melancholy illustration of the
state of society, alludes to the true but romantic marriage of the Lord Burghley, who,
staying at a country village in Shropshire as a landscape painter, under the assumed
name of Jones, married, in 1791, being then about the age of 37, a country maiden
named Sarah Hoggins. After their marriage, Lord Burghley becomes Marquess of
Exeter in 1793, and takes his wife, to her surprise, to his magnificent mansion of
Burghley House, near Stamford Town, where she afterwards dies in 1797. The
incident is described in one of the most beautiful poems Tennyson has ever written.
Vinge, whilst he admires the poem, sees much to deplore in the fact that such a state
of society should exist, in which a village maid, when she married a nobleman, should
feel oppressed, to use the words of Tennyson,

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With the burthen of an honour<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unto which she was not born.”<br /></span>
</span></span>

Vinge forgets that the village maiden may have done worse in her own position of
life. It was quite within the range of possibility for her to have a husband, who,
when occasionally inebriated, might sometimes give her a good beating, or indulge in
language not suited to the poetry of Vinge. The poet also overlooks the fact that
Lord Burghley gave an honourable love to the village maid. He did not deceive her,
but, as Tennyson beautifully describes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“An’ a gentle consort made he;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And her gentle mind was such,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That she grew a noble lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the people loved her much.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor did the Lord Burghley forget the maiden’s relatives and friends; but made a
most ample provision for them. One feels some pride that in England a respectable
village girl, whose countenance is said to have expressed sensibility, purity, and
happiness, should have had that respect due to her change of rank, and be received
at court, where her quiet, unassuming manners are said to have been much admired
by her Majesty Queen Charlotte. “But,” says Vinge, “she was not born to honour.
There is the deep cause of all the mischief, and it is no burlesque; on the contrary,
it is very pathetic.”</p>

<p>Still we do not see any reason for the poet’s complaint; and though the Lady of
Burghley died early, the Marquess did not long survive her, for he died in 1804, and
society could not have had anything to do with his death. The present Marquess and
Earl of Exeter is their grandson. In allusion to the death of the Lady of Burghley,
the poet laureate concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“So she droop’d and droop’d before him,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Fading slowly by his side;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Three fair children first she bore him,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then before her time she died.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Weeping, weeping late and early,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Walking up and pacing down,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Deeply mourned the Lord of Burghley,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Burghley House by Stamford Town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And he came to look upon her,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And he looked at her and said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">‘Bring the dress, and put it on her,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That she wore when she was wed.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then the people, softly treading,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Bore to earth her body, drest<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the dress that she was wed in,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That her spirit might have rest.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vinge has also published a collection of poems, sketches of travels, scraps of poetry
and prose, and a long epic poem called “Store Gut” (the big boy). Lastly he published
“Vaar Politik” and “Om Professor Schweigaard.” The last named work he
had just published when he died, 30 July, 1870. Vinge was one of those visionary
poets who would take society up by the roots and plant it branches downwards,
expecting it to thrive and flourish. It seldom answers in nature; but then poets
cannot be judged by the standard of ordinary men. Shelley and Vinge were of such.
His life was an unbroken struggle. He was a highly intellectual and most interesting
man. In Gran churchyard, Hadeland, rest the remains of Aasmund Olafsen Vinge.</p></div>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
